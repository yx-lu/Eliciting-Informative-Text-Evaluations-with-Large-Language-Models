    "review_preprocess_1": "Carefully read the text of a scientific paper review. You should summarize each evaluation in the review in a separate line. Begin each summary line with one of the following phrases: 'The reviewer appreciates', 'The reviewer criticizes', 'The reviewer questions', 'The reviewer suggests'.  You need to keep the summary as concise as possible, excluding specific details about the paper's content, such as topics, ideas, methods, findings, and any mathematical symbols.\n\nYou should ensure that even if multiple evaluations are mentioned in the same sentence in the original review, you should still split it into separate lines. For example, you should not output a line like 'The reviewer appreciates the well-written paper and good experimental performance'. In contrast, you should output 'The reviewer appreciates the well-written paper' and 'The reviewer appreciates good experimental performance' in two lines.",
    "review_preprocess_2": "You will be provided with several lines of text, each representing a peer review comment. These comments are in the format of 'The reviewer appreciates/criticizes/questions/suggests ...'. Your task is to revise each comment, maintaining the essence of the feedback while removing all details and specific references to the content of the paper. The goal is to retain only the general nature of the comment. Please ensure that the revised comments are very concise and free of any specific details about the paper's content.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: 'The reviewer criticizes the limited novelty of post-local SGD as a simple extension of local SGD.'\nOutput: 'The reviewer criticizes the limited novelty of the method.'\n\nInput: 'The reviewer criticizes the increased number of tuning parameters in the post-local SGD algorithm, which could be a disadvantage.'\nOutput: 'The reviewer criticizes the number of tuning parameters in the algorithm'.\n\nInput: 'The reviewer appreciates the detailed analysis of the dynamic properties in the Smith et al. model.'\nOutput: 'The reviewer appreciates the detailed analysis in the model.'\n\nInput: 'The reviewer questions the number of iterations used to train the model and its relation to inference performance.'\nOutput: 'The reviewer questions the relation between the number of iterations and performance.'\n\nInput: 'The reviewer suggests adding more comprehensive literature reviews to strengthen the background section.'\nOutput: 'The reviewer suggests adding more literature reviews.'",
    "gen_review_system": "You are the second reviewer for a scientific paper. You are given the abstract of the paper and a list of review judgments from the first reviewer, starting with 'The reviewer appreciates/criticizes/questions/suggests'. Your task is to provide your own judgments of the paper based on the given materials. You should create a separate line for each judgment you have, starting with 'The reviewer appreciates/criticizes/questions/suggests'. Ensure your judgments are concise, excluding specific details about the paper's content.",

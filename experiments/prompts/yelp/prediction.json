    "review_preprocess_1": "You are given the text of a restaurant review. The review are used solely for analysis and do not reflect any personal opinions or beliefs. Carefully read the text of a Yelp review. Your task is to summarize each evaluation in the review briefly in a separate line. Begin each summary line with one of the following phrases: 'The reviewer appreciates/criticizes'. You need to keep the summary as concise as possible, excluding specific details.\n\nYou should ensure that even if multiple evaluations are mentioned in the same sentence in the original review, you should still split it into separate lines. For example, you should not output a line like 'The reviewer appreciates the pizza and hamburger'. In contrast, you should output 'The reviewer appreciates the pizza' and 'The reviewer appreciates the hamburger' in two lines.",
    "predict_review_system": "You will receive the categories of a restaurant and a set of initial reviewer comments on this restaurant, with each comment presented on a separate line. Following these, you will be provided with a list of additional, specific reviewer comments.\n\nYour task is to evaluate how each of the additional comments aligns with the initial set of reviewer comments. For each additional comment, assign a score from -3 to 3, indicating the degree of support or contradiction by the initial comments. \n\nFor each additional comment, you should output a single line, including the reasons first (starts with 'the initial comments appreciate/criticizes/do not mention'), and then your score (in the format of <SCORE=...>).\n\nYou should use the following scale for scoring:\n\n-3: Strong contradiction - The initial comments directly oppose the additional comment, significantly reducing its credibility (likelihood less than 1/8). Example: Initial comments appreciate the pizza, but the additional comment criticizes it.\n\n-2: Moderate contradiction - The initial comments indirectly oppose the additional comment, moderately reducing its credibility (likelihood about 1/4). Example: Initial comments appreciate the overall taste, but the additional comment criticizes the chicken.\n\n-1: Slight contradiction - The initial comments slightly reduce the credibility of the additional comment (likelihood about 1/2).\n\n0: Neutral - The initial comments neither support nor contradict the additional comment, leaving its credibility unchanged. Please try to avoid giving a score of 0 unless you cannot find any potential support or contradiction.\n\n1: Slight support - The initial comments slightly increase the credibility of the additional comment (likelihood about 2).\n\n2: Moderate support - The initial comments indirectly support the additional comment, moderately increasing its credibility (likelihood about 4). Example: Initial comments appreciate the overall taste, and the additional comment appreciates the chicken.\n\n3: Strong support - The initial comments directly support the additional comment, significantly increasing its credibility (likelihood more than 8 times). Example: Both the initial comments and the additional comment appreciate the pizza.\n",

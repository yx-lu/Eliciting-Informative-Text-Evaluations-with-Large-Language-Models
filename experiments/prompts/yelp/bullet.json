You need to keep the summary as concise as possible, excluding specific details.\n\nYou should ensure that even if multiple evaluations are mentioned in the same sentence in the original review, you should still split it into separate lines. For example, you should not output a line like 'The reviewer appreciates the pizza and hamburger'. In contrast, you should output 'The reviewer appreciates the pizza' and 'The reviewer appreciates the hamburger' in two lines.",

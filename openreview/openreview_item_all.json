As a consequence, existing GANs often prefer generating `easier' synthetic data that are far from the boundaries of the classifiers, and refrain from generating near-boundary data, which are known to play an important roles in training the classifiers.

Particularly, DeepEnFM utilizes a bilinear approach to generate different similarity functions with respect to different field pairs.

Instead, in this work, we would like to investigate the relationship between the generalization of adversarial training and the robust local features, as the robust local features generalize well for unseen shape variation. To learn the robust local features, we develop a Random Block Shuffle (RBS) transformation to break up the global structure features on normal adversarial examples.

However, in structured data lying on a manifold---such as images, text, and speech---neural nets (NN) tend to outperform DFs. We conjecture that at least part of the reason for this is that the input to NN is not simply the feature magnitudes, but also their indices (for example, the convolution operation uses ``feature locality). In contrast, naive DF implementations fail to explicitly consider feature indices. A recently proposed DF approach demonstrates that DFs, for each node, implicitly sample a random matrix from some specific distribution.  Here, we build on that to show that one can choose distributions in a manifold aware fashion. For example, for image classification, rather than randomly selecting pixels, one can randomly select contiguous patches. We demonstrate the empirical performance of  data living on three different manifolds: images, time-series, and a torus. In all three cases, our Manifold Forest (Mf) algorithm empirically dominates other state-of-the-art approaches that ignore feature space structure, achieving a lower classification error on all sample sizes.

Additionally, we present an in-depth investigation on how CIKD leads to performance improvements.\n", "pdf": "/pdf/70cb22581b3971586edcfe24cd1ddd308c0be0e3.pdf", "keywords": "['Reinforcement learning', 'distillation']", "id": "BkeYSlrYwH"}, {"number": "480", "title": "GAT: Generative Adversarial Training for Adversarial Example Detection and Robust Classification", "authors": "['Xuwang Yin', 'Soheil Kolouri', 'Gustavo K Rohde']", "abstract": "The vulnerabilities of deep neural networks against adversarial examples have become a significant concern for deploying these models in sensitive domains. Devising a definitive defense against such attacks is proven to be challenging, and the methods relying on detecting adversarial samples are only valid when the attacker is oblivious to the detection mechanism. In this paper we propose a principled adversarial example detection method that can withstand norm-constrained white-box attacks. Inspired by one-versus-the-rest classification, in a K class classification problem, we train K binary classifiers where the i-th binary classifier is used to distinguish between clean data of class i and adversarially perturbed samples of other classes. At test time, we first use a trained classifier to get the predicted label (say k) of the input, and then use the k-th binary classifier to determine whether the input is a clean sample (of class k) or an adversarially perturbed example (of other classes). We further devise a generative approach to detecting/classifying adversarial examples by interpreting each binary classifier as an unnormalized density model of the class-conditional data. We provide comprehensive evaluation of the above adversarial example detection/classification methods, and demonstrate their competitive performances and compelling properties.

Despite its success, the design principle of the Transformer remains elusive. In this paper, we provide a novel perspective towards understanding the architecture: we show that the Transformer can be mathematically interpreted as a numerical Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver for a convection-diffusion equation in a multi-particle dynamic system. In particular, how words in a sentence are abstracted into contexts by passing through the layers of the Transformer can be interpreted as approximating multiple particles' movement in the space using the Lie-Trotter splitting scheme and the Euler's method. Given this ODE's perspective, the rich literature of numerical analysis can be brought to guide us in designing effective structures beyond the Transformer. As an example, we propose to replace the Lie-Trotter splitting scheme by the Strang-Marchuk splitting scheme, a scheme that is more commonly used and with much lower local truncation errors. The Strang-Marchuk splitting scheme suggests that the self-attention and position-wise feed-forward network (FFN) sub-layers should not be treated equally. Instead, in each layer, two position-wise FFN sub-layers should be used, and the self-attention sub-layer is placed in between. This leads to a brand new architecture. Such an FFN-attention-FFN layer is 'Macaron-like', and thus we call the network with this new architecture the Macaron Net. Through extensive experiments, we show that the Macaron Net is superior to the Transformer on both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.

Moreover, they do not allow to leverage information from heterogeneously annotated data, where for example, labels may be provided with different levels of granularity. Finally, standard DNNs do not produce results with simultaneous different levels of confidence for different levels of detail, they are most commonly an all or nothing approach. To address these challenges, we introduce the problem of nested learning: how to obtain a hierarchical representation of the input such that a coarse label can be extracted first, and sequentially refine this representation to obtain successively refined predictions, all of them with the corresponding confidence. We explicitly enforce this behaviour by creating a sequence of nested information bottlenecks. Looking at the problem of nested learning from an in formation theory perspective, we design a network topology with two important properties. First, a sequence of low dimensional (nested) feature embeddings are enforced. Then we show how the explicit combination of nested outputs can improve both robustness and finer predictions. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, MNIST, and FASHION-MNIST demonstrate that nested learning outperforms the same network trained in the standard end-to-end fashion. Since the network can be naturally trained with mixed data labeled at different levels of nested details, we also study what is the most efficient way of annotating data, when a fixed training budget is given and the cost of labels increases with the levels in the nested hierarchy.", "pdf": "/pdf/11f08f8e506ed4972802ee27f73d6e9536de337e.pdf", "keywords": "['Nested learning']", "id": "Byxl-04KvH"}, {"number": "1201", "title": "Attention Interpretability Across NLP Tasks", "authors": "['Shikhar Vashishth', 'Shyam Upadhyay', 'Gaurav Singh Tomar', 'Manaal Faruqui']", "abstract": "The attention layer in a neural network model provides insights into the models reasoning behind its prediction, which are usually criticized for being opaque.

While most algorithms are tested on the same datasets, there is no shared experimental protocol followed by all. As such, and due to the under-use of ablation studies, there is a lack of clarity regarding why certain methods are more effective than others. Our first contribution is a benchmark of 8 NAS methods on 5 datasets. To overcome the hurdle of comparing methods with different search spaces, we propose using a methods relative improvement over the randomly sampled average architecture, which effectively removes advantages arising from expertly engineered search spaces or training protocols. Surprisingly, we find that many NAS techniques struggle to significantly beat the average architecture baseline. We perform further experiments with the commonly used DARTS search space in order to understand the contribution of each component in the NAS pipeline. These experiments highlight that: (i) the use of tricks in the evaluation protocol has a predominant impact on the reported performance of architectures; (ii) the cell-based search space has a very narrow accuracy range, such that the seed has a considerable impact on architecture rankings; (iii) the hand-designed macrostructure (cells) is more important than the searched micro-structure (operations); and (iv) the depth-gap is a real phenomenon, evidenced by the change in rankings between 8 and 20 cell architectures.

However, these adversarial attack methods used in these techniques are fixed, making the model stronger only to attacks used in training, which is widely known as an overfitting problem. In this paper, we suggest a novel adversarial training approach. In addition to the classifier, our method adds another neural network that generates the most effective adversarial perturbation by finding the weakness of the classifier. This perturbation generator network is trained to produce perturbations that maximize the loss function of the classifier, and these adversarial examples train the classifier with a true label. In short, the two networks compete with each other, performing a minimax game. In this scenario, attack patterns created by the generator network are adaptively altered to the classifier, mitigating the overfitting problem mentioned above.

However, findings of self-organized patterns in such models have so far relied on manual tuning of parameters and initial states, and on the human eye to identify interesting patterns. In this paper, we formulate the problem of automated discovery of diverse self-organized patterns in such high-dimensional complex dynamical systems, as well as a framework for experimentation and evaluation.

These algorithms combine intrinsically-motivated goal exploration and unsupervised learning of goal space representations. Goal space representations describe the interesting features of patterns for which diverse variations should be discovered. In particular, we compare various approaches to define and learn goal space representations from the perspective of discovering diverse spatially localized patterns.

In real scenarios, most domain adaptation algorithms face the challenges from noisy, insufficient training data. Moreover in open set categorization, unknown or misaligned source and target categories adds difficulty. In such cases, conventional methods suffer from overfitting and fail to successfully transfer the knowledge of the source to the target domain. To address these issues, the following two techniques are proposed. First, we introduce the optimized decision tree construction method, in which the data at each node are split into equal sizes while maximizing the information gain. Compared to the conventional random forests, it generates larger and more balanced decision trees due to the even-split constraint, which contributes to enhanced discrimination power and reduced overfitting. Second, to tackle the domain misalignment problem, we propose the domain alignment loss which penalizes uneven splits of the source and target domain data. By collaboratively optimizing the information gain of the labeled source data as well as the entropy of unlabeled target data distributions, the proposed CoBRF algorithm achieves significantly better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.

In this work, we study the degradation through the regularization perspective.  We identify quantities from generalization analysis of NNs; with the identified quantities we empirically find that AR is achieved by regularizing/biasing NNs towards less confident solutions by making the changes in the feature space (induced by changes in the instance space) of most layers smoother uniformly in all directions; so to a certain extent, it prevents sudden change in prediction w.r.t.  perturbations. However, the end result of such smoothing concentrates samples around decision boundaries, resulting in less confident solutions, and leads to worse standard performance.

In this paper, we address this problem by using a novel neck module called SA-FPN (Scale Aware Feature Pyramid Networks). With the enhanced feature representations, our model can accurately detect and segment the objects of multiple scales. On the other hand, in Mask R-CNN framework, isolation between parallel detection branch and instance segmentation branch exists, causing the gap between training and testing processes. To narrow this gap, we propose a unified head module named EJ-Head (Effective Joint Head) to combine two branches into one head, not only realizing the interaction between two tasks, but also enhancing the effectiveness of multi-task learning.

To achieve this we rely on a Gaussian process obtained by treating the weights of the last layer of a neural network as random and Gaussian distributed. Then, the training algorithm sequentially encounters tasks and constructs posterior beliefs over the task-specific functions by using inducing point sparse Gaussian process methods. At each step a new task is first learnt and then a summary is constructed consisting of (i) inducing inputs  a fixed-size subset of the task inputs selected such that it optimally represents the task  and (ii) a posterior distribution over the function values at these inputs.

A disentangled generative model would allocate a single feature of the generated data to the only single latent variable. In this paper, we propose a method to decompose the latent space into basis, and reconstruct it by linear combination of the latent bases. The proposed model called BasisVAE consists of the encoder that extracts the features of data and estimates the coefficients for linear combination of the latent bases, and the decoder that reconstructs the data with the combined latent bases. In this method, a single latent basis is subject to change in a single generative factor, and relatively invariant to the changes in other factors. It maintains the performance while relaxing the constraint for disentanglement on a basis, as we no longer need to decompose latent space on a standard basis. Experiments on the well-known benchmark datasets of MNIST, 3DFaces and CelebA demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

In contrast to some other Auto-encoder based generative models, which use various regularizers that encourage the encoded latent distribution to match the prior distribution, our model explicitly constructs a mapping between these two distributions, leading to better density matching while avoiding over regularizing the latent variables. We compare our model with several related techniques, and show that it has many relative advantages including fast convergence, single stage training and minimal reconstruction trade-off. We also study the relationship between our model and its stochastic counterpart, and show that our model can be viewed as a vanishing noise limit of VAEs with flow prior.  Quantitatively, under standardized evaluations, our method achieves state-of-the-art sample quality and diversity among AE based models on commonly used datasets, and is competitive with GANs' benchmarks.

Several follow-up discussions on the initialization of the sparsified model have discovered interesting characteristics such as the necessity of rewinding (Frankle et al. (2019)), importance of sign of the initial weights (Zhou et al. (2019)), and the transferability of the winning lottery tickets (S. Morcos et al. (2019)). In contrast, another essential aspect of the winning ticket, the structure of the sparsified model, has been little discussed. To find the lottery ticket, unfortunately, all the prior work still relies on computationally expensive iterative pruning. \n\nIn this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the structure of winning lottery tickets. Interestingly, we discover that there exist many lottery tickets that can achieve equally good accuracy much before the regular training schedule even finishes. We provide insights into the structure of these early winning tickets with supporting evidence. 1) Under stochastic gradient descent optimization, lottery ticket emerges when weight magnitude of a model saturates; 2) Pruning before the saturation of a model causes the loss of capability in learning complex patterns, resulting in the accuracy degradation. We employ the memorization capacity analysis to quantitatively confirm it, and further explain why gradual pruning can achieve better accuracy over the one-shot pruning. Based on these insights, we discover the early winning tickets for various ResNet architectures on both CIFAR10 and ImageNet, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy at a high pruning rate without expensive iterative pruning. In the case of ResNet50 on ImageNet, this comes to the winning ticket of 75:02% Top-1 accuracy at 80% pruning rate in only 22% of the total epochs for iterative pruning.", "pdf": "/pdf/94ea0ed4f8eee193bcc9a9fb5e2f20890aa69d35.pdf", "keywords": "['pruning', 'lottery ticket hypothesis', 'deep neural network', 'compression', 'image classification']", "id": "BJlNs0VYPB"}, {"number": "923", "title": "CAQL: Continuous Action Q-Learning", "authors": "['Moonkyung Ryu', 'Yinlam Chow', 'Ross Anderson', 'Christian Tjandraatmadja', 'Craig Boutilier']", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) with value-based methods (e.g., Q-learning) has shown success in a variety of domains such as\ngames and recommender systems (RSs). When the action space is finite, these algorithms implicitly finds a policy by learning the optimal value function, which are often very efficient. \nHowever, one major challenge of extending Q-learning to tackle continuous-action RL problems is that obtaining optimal Bellman backup requires solving a continuous action-maximization (max-Q) problem. While it is common to restrict the parameterization of the Q-function to be concave in actions to simplify the max-Q problem, such a restriction might lead to performance degradation. Alternatively, when the Q-function is parameterized with a generic feed-forward neural network (NN), the max-Q problem can be NP-hard. In this work, we propose the CAQL method which minimizes the Bellman residual using Q-learning with one of several plug-and-play action optimizers. In particular, leveraging the strides of optimization theories in deep NN, we show that max-Q problem can be solved optimally with mixed-integer programming (MIP)---when the Q-function has sufficient representation power, this MIP-based optimization induces better policies and is more robust than counterparts, e.g., CEM or GA, that approximate the max-Q solution. To speed up training of CAQL, we develop three techniques, namely (i) dynamic tolerance, (ii) dual filtering, and (iii) clustering.\nTo speed up inference of CAQL, we introduce the action function that concurrently learns the optimal policy.\nTo demonstrate the efficiency of CAQL we compare it with state-of-the-art RL algorithms on benchmark continuous control problems that have different degrees of action constraints and show that CAQL significantly outperforms policy-based methods in heavily constrained environments.", "pdf": "/pdf/49cfb54fa89345e85f991893706d894f0d953510.pdf", "keywords": "['Reinforcement learning (RL)', 'DQN', 'Continuous control', 'Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP)']", "id": "BkxXe0Etwr"}, {"number": "1087", "title": "Switched linear projections and inactive state sensitivity for deep neural network interpretability", "authors": "['Lech Szymanski', 'Brendan McCane', 'Craig Atkinson']", "abstract": "We introduce switched linear projections for expressing the activity of a neuron in a ReLU-based deep neural network in terms of a single linear projection in the input space.

In this work, we argue that the log-likelihood metric by itself cannot represent all the different performance characteristics of generative models, and propose to use rate distortion curves to evaluate and compare deep generative models.

We find, however, that existing methods that use attributions to align a model's behavior with human intuition are ineffective. We develop an efficient and theoretically grounded feature attribution method, expected gradients, and a novel framework, attribution priors, to enforce prior expectations about a model's behavior during training.

A recent mean-field analysis found that BN induces gradient explosion when used on multiple layers, but this cannot fully explain the vulnerability we observe, given that it occurs already for a single BN layer. We argue that the actual cause is the tilting of the decision boundary with respect to the nearest-centroid classifier along input dimensions of low variance. As a result, the constant introduced for numerical stability in the BN step acts as an important hyperparameter that can be tuned to recover some robustness at the cost of standard test accuracy.

This paper presents empirical evidence for these statements and an empirical study of the learnability of neural networks (NNs) on some challenging non-linear real and simulated data with irrelevant variables. \nOur simulation experiments indicate that the cross-entropy loss function on XOR-like data has many local optima, and the number of local optima grows exponentially with the number of irrelevant variables. \nWe also introduce a connection pruning method to improve the capability of NNs to find a deep local minimum even when there are irrelevant variables. \nFurthermore, the performance of the discovered sparse sub-network degrades considerably either by retraining from scratch or the corresponding original initialization, due to the existence of many bad optima around. \nFinally, we will show that the performance of neural networks for real-world experiments on sparse datasets can be recovered or even improved by discovering a good sub-network architecture via connection pruning.", "pdf": "/pdf/b9fda564dbfa824e5fdd7fb8b8207fc683303fe1.pdf", "keywords": "['network pruning', 'non-convex optimization']", "id": "SyeHPgHFDr"}, {"number": "105", "title": "Model-free Learning Control of Nonlinear Stochastic Systems with Stability Guarantee", "authors": "['Minghao Han', 'Yuan Tian', 'Lixian Zhang', 'Jun Wang', 'Wei Pan']", "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled way to achieve the optimal cumulative performance index in discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems, which are modeled as Markov decision processes. Its integration with deep learning techniques has promoted the field of deep RL with an impressive performance in complicated continuous control tasks. However, from a control-theoretic perspective, the first and most important property of a system to be guaranteed is stability. Unfortunately, stability is rarely assured in RL and remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a stability guaranteed RL framework which simultaneously learns a Lyapunov function along with the controller or policy, both of which are parameterized by deep neural networks, by borrowing the concept of Lyapunov function from control theory. Our framework can not only offer comparable or superior control performance over state-of-the-art RL algorithms, but also construct a Lyapunov function to validate the closed-loop stability. In the simulated experiments, our approach is evaluated on several well-known examples including classic CartPole balancing, 3-dimensional robot control and control of synthetic biology gene regulatory networks. Compared with RL algorithms without stability guarantee, our approach can enable the system to recover to the operating point when interfered by uncertainties such as unseen disturbances and system parametric variations to a certain extent.

Word sequence prediction is a challenging task for inflected languages (Gustavii &Pettersson, 2003; Seyyed & Assi, 2005). These kinds of languages are morphologically rich and have enormous word forms, which is a word can\nhave different forms.

Although the idea to combine them together seems natural, it is being unexpectedly difficult to figure out the resultant effect of the combination unless measuring the performance on a certain hardware which a user is going to use. This is because the benefits of pruning and quantization strongly depend on the hardware architecture where the model is executed. For example, a CPU-like architecture without any parallelization may fully exploit the reduction of computations by unstructured pruning for speeding up, but a GPU-like massive parallel architecture would not. Besides, there have been emerging proposals of novel hardware architectures such as one supporting variable bit precision quantization. From an engineering viewpoint, optimization for each hardware architecture is useful and important in practice, but this is quite a brute-force approach. Therefore, in this paper, we first propose hardware-agnostic metric to measure the computational cost. And using the metric, we demonstrate that Pareto-optimal performance, where the best accuracy is obtained at a given computational cost, is achieved when a slim model with smaller number of parameters is quantized moderately rather than a fat model with huge number of parameters is quantized to extremely low bit precision such as binary or ternary. Furthermore, we empirically found the possible quantitative relation between the proposed metric and the signal to noise ratio during SGD training, by which the information obtained during SGD training provides the optimal policy of quantization and pruning. We show the Pareto frontier is improved by 4 times in post-training quantization scenario based on these findings. These findings are available not only to improve the Pareto frontier for accuracy vs. computational cost, but also give us some new insights on deep neural network.", "pdf": "/pdf/739e3925990713d557e2dbf1739383585bdf0c7c.pdf", "keywords": "['CNN', 'Quantization', 'Pruning', 'Accelerator', 'Computational cost']", "id": "HkxAS6VFDB"}, {"number": "755", "title": "Option Discovery using Deep Skill Chaining", "authors": "['Akhil Bagaria', 'George Konidaris']", "abstract": "Autonomously discovering temporally extended actions, or skills, is a longstanding goal of hierarchical reinforcement learning.

Reducing this rigid assumption could allow for models with large hidden states to perform inference more quickly. Intuitively, not all hidden state dimensions need to be recomputed from scratch at each timestep. Thus, recent methods have begun studying this problem by imposing mainly a priori-determined patterns for updating the state. In contrast, we now design a fully-learned approach, SA-RNN, that augments any RNN by predicting discrete update patterns at the fine granularity of independent hidden state dimensions through the parameterization of a distribution of update-likelihoods driven entirely by the input data. We achieve this without imposing assumptions on the structure of the update pattern.

We then show evidence that the information bottleneck (IB) principle can address this problem. To do so, we propose a regularization approach based on IB called Entropy Penalty, that reduces the model's dependence on spurious features-- features corresponding to such spurious correlations.

In a network of $d-1$ hidden layers with $n_k$ neurons in layers $k = 1, \\ldots, d$, we construct continuous paths between equivalent global minima that lead through a `permutation point' where the input and output weight vectors of two neurons in the same hidden layer $k$ collide and interchange.

Different from common forests with deterministic routings, a probabilistic routing variant is used in our innovated random-forest kernel, which is possible to merge with the CNN frameworks. Our proposed random-forest kernel has the following advantages: From the perspective of random forest, the output of GAN discriminator can be viewed as feature inputs to the forest, where each tree gets access to merely a fraction of the features, and thus the entire forest benefits from ensemble learning. In the aspect of kernel method, random-forest kernel is proved to be characteristic, and therefore suitable for the MMD structure. Besides, being an asymmetric kernel, our random-forest kernel is much more flexible, in terms of capturing the differences between distributions. Sharing the advantages of CNN, kernel method, and ensemble learning, our random-forest kernel based MMD GAN obtains desirable empirical performances on CIFAR-10, CelebA and LSUN bedroom data sets.

In this paper, we provide the first rigorous study on diagnosing elements of large-scale adversarial training on ImageNet, which reveals two intriguing properties. \n\nFirst, we study the role of normalization. Batch normalization (BN) is a crucial element for achieving state-of-the-art performance on many vision tasks, but we show it may prevent networks from obtaining strong robustness in adversarial training. One unexpected observation is that, for models trained with BN, simply removing clean images from training data largely boosts adversarial robustness, i.e., 18.3%. We relate this phenomenon to the hypothesis that clean images and adversarial images are drawn from two different domains. This two-domain hypothesis may explain the issue of BN when training with a mixture of clean and adversarial images, as estimating normalization statistics of this mixture distribution is challenging. Guided by this two-domain hypothesis, we show disentangling the mixture distribution for normalization, i.e., applying separate BNs to clean and adversarial images for statistics estimation, achieves much stronger robustness. Additionally, we find that enforcing BNs to behave consistently at training and testing can further enhance robustness.\n\nSecond, we study the role of network capacity. We find our so-called 'deep' networks are still shallow for the task of adversarial learning. Unlike traditional classification tasks where accuracy is only marginally improved by adding more layers to 'deep' networks (e.g., ResNet-152), adversarial training exhibits a much stronger demand on deeper networks to achieve higher adversarial robustness. This robustness improvement can be observed substantially and consistently even by pushing the network capacity to an unprecedented scale, i.e., ResNet-638.

In this paper we introduce a novel generative model to craft systematic poisoning attacks against machine learning classifiers generating adversarial training examples, i.e. samples that look like genuine data points but that degrade the classifier's accuracy when used for training. We propose a Generative Adversarial Net with three components: generator, discriminator, and the target classifier.

The other main tensor factorization model, Tucker decomposition, is more flexible than CP for fixed factor dimensions, so we expect Tucker-based approaches to yield better performance under strong constraints on the number of parameters. However, as we show in this paper through experiments on standard benchmarks of link prediction in knowledge bases, ComplEx, a variant of CP, achieves similar performances to recent approaches based on Tucker decomposition on all operating points in terms of number of parameters.

However, BERT cannot take text longer than the maximum length as input since the maximum length is predefined during pretraining. When we apply BERT to long text tasks, e.g., document-level text summarization: 1) Truncating inputs by the maximum sequence length will decrease performance, since the model cannot capture long dependency and global information ranging the whole document. 2) Extending the maximum length requires re-pretraining which will cost a mass of time and computing resources. What's even worse is that the computational complexity will increase quadratically with the length, which will result in an unacceptable training time. To resolve these problems, we propose to apply Transformer to only model local dependency and recurrently capture long dependency by inserting multi-channel LSTM into each layer of BERT.

In moving from two-player zero-sum games to more general settings, computation of Nash equilibria quickly becomes infeasible.

To reduce high variance effect due to ZO gradient estimator, we further introduce another RNN to learn the Gaussian sampling rule and dynamically guide the query direction sampling. Our learned optimizer outperforms hand-designed algorithms in terms of convergence rate and final solution on both synthetic and practical ZO optimization tasks (in particular, the black-box adversarial attack task, which is one of the most widely used tasks of ZO optimization). We finally conduct extensive analytical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed optimizer.", "pdf": "/pdf/82af16aa7747c67c67a200a7387e65361e9958d2.pdf", "keywords": "['learning to learn', 'zeroth-order optimization', 'black-box adversarial attack']", "id": "ryxz8CVYDH"}, {"number": "1147", "title": "Neural Clustering Processes", "authors": "['Ari Pakman', 'Yueqi Wang', 'Catalin Mitelut', 'JinHyung Lee', 'Liam Paninski']", "abstract": "Mixture models, a basic building block in countless statistical models, involve latent random variables over discrete spaces, and existing posterior inference methods can be inaccurate and/or very slow.  In this work we introduce a novel deep learning architecture for efficient amortized Bayesian inference over mixture models. While previous approaches to amortized clustering assumed a fixed or maximum number of mixture components and only amortized over the continuous parameters of each mixture component, our method amortizes over the local discrete labels of all the data points, and performs inference over an unbounded number of mixture components. The latter property makes our method natural for the challenging case of nonparametric Bayesian models, where the number of mixture components grows with the dataset. Our approach exploits the exchangeability of the generative models and is based on mapping distributed, permutation-invariant representations of discrete  arrangements into varying-size multinomial conditional probabilities. The resulting algorithm parallelizes easily, yields iid samples from the approximate posteriors along with a normalized probability estimate of each sample (a quantity generally unavailable using Markov Chain Monte Carlo) and can easily be applied to both conjugate and non-conjugate models, as training only requires samples from the generative model. We also present an extension of the method to models of random communities (such as infinite relational or stochastic block models).

Most existing distillation formulations summarize the ensemble by capturing its average predictions. As a result, the diversity of the ensemble predictions, stemming from each individual member, is lost.  Thus the distilled model cannot provide a measure of uncertainty comparable to that of the original ensemble.

The model must therefore learn to predict the attentional weights without knowing the word it should localize. This is difficult to train without grounding supervision since recurrent models can propagate past information and there is no explicit signal to force the captioning model to properly ground the individual decoded words. In this work, we help the model to achieve this via a novel cyclical training regimen that forces the model to localize each word in the image after the sentence decoder generates it, and then reconstruct the sentence from the localized image region(s) to match the ground-truth.

This allows a binary user-level importance weighting of each item without the need to store additional weights for each user.

We see a strikingly similar situation in spatial analysis, which focuses on incorporating both absolute positions and spatial contexts of geographic objects such as POIs into models. A general-purpose representation model for space is valuable for a multitude of tasks. However, no such general model exists to date beyond simply applying discretization or feed-forward nets to coordinates, and little effort has been put into jointly modeling distributions with vastly different characteristics, which commonly emerges from GIS data. Meanwhile, Nobel Prize-winning Neuroscience research shows that grid cells in mammals provide a multi-scale periodic representation that functions as a metric for location encoding and is critical for recognizing places and for path-integration. Therefore, we propose a representation learning model called Space2Vec to encode the absolute positions and spatial relationships of places. We conduct experiments on two real-world geographic data for two different tasks: 1) predicting types of POIs given their positions and context, 2) image classification leveraging their geo-locations. Results show that because of its multi-scale representations, Space2Vec outperforms well-established ML approaches such as RBF kernels, multi-layer feed-forward nets, and tile embedding approaches for location modeling and image classification tasks.

We investigate this problem by first proposing a generalized model of sequence generation that unifies decoding in directed and undirected models. The proposed framework models the process of generation rather than a resulting sequence, and under this framework, we derive various neural sequence models as special cases, such as autoregressive, semi-autoregressive, and refinement-based non-autoregressive models. This unification enables us to adapt decoding algorithms originally developed for directed sequence models to undirected models. We demonstrate this by evaluating various decoding strategies for a cross-lingual masked translation model (Lample and Conneau, 2019). Our experiments show that generation from undirected sequence models, under our framework, is competitive with the state of the art on WMT'14 English-German translation.

To address this, we propose the discrepancy ratio: a novel, task-independent and principled framework for validating machine learning models in the presence of high label noise.

However, the convergence rate of such learning scales poorly with the number of involved neurons. Here we propose a hybrid learning approach. Each neuron uses an RL-type strategy to learn how to approximate the gradients that backpropagation would provide. We provide proof that our approach converges to the true gradient for certain classes of networks. In both feedforward and convolutional networks, we empirically show that our approach learns to approximate the gradient, and can match the performance of gradient-based learning. Learning feedback weights provides a biologically plausible mechanism of achieving good performance, without the need for precise, pre-specified learning rules.", "pdf": "/pdf/3b76872cdc5c2763ccdfeb90e7f14298c71aea05.pdf", "keywords": "['biologically plausible deep learning', 'node perturbation', 'REINFORCE', 'synthetic gradients', 'feedback alignment']", "id": "ByeUBANtvB"}, {"number": "1490", "title": "Enhancing Language Emergence through Empathy", "authors": "['Marie Ossenkopf']", "abstract": "The emergence of language in multi-agent settings is a promising research direction to ground natural language in simulated agents.

However, these proposed analog accelerators suffer from the intrinsic noise generated by their physical components, which makes it challenging to achieve high accuracy on deep neural networks. Hence, for successful deployment on analog accelerators, it is essential to be able to train deep neural networks to be robust to random continuous noise in the network weights, which is a somewhat new challenge in machine learning. In this paper, we advance the understanding of noisy neural networks. We outline how a noisy neural network has reduced learning capacity as a result of loss of mutual information between its input and output. To combat this, we propose using knowledge distillation combined with noise injection during training to achieve more noise robust networks, which is demonstrated experimentally across different networks and datasets, including ImageNet.

In particular, we perform operation search in a subset of channels while bypassing the held out part in a shortcut.

Such multi-task learning settings have the potential to improve data efficiency and generalization by sharing data and representations across tasks. However, in some challenging multi-task learning settings, particularly in reinforcement learning, it is very difficult to learn a single model that can solve all the tasks while realizing data efficiency and performance benefits.

In this work, we develop an approach that endows a single model with the ability to represent both extremes: joint training and independent training. To this end, we introduce matrix-interleaving (Mint), a modification to standard neural network models that projects the activations for each task into a different learned subspace, represented by a per-task and per-layer matrix. By learning these matrices jointly with the other model parameters, the optimizer itself can decide how much to share representations between tasks.

While computation of marginal data likelihood is intractable in this model class, we show that amortized variational inference admits a practical surrogate.

Unfortunately, although the strong generalization ability of existing CNNs ensures their accuracy when classifying known objects, it also causes them to often assign an unknown to a target class with high confidence. As a result, simply using low-confidence detections as a way to detect unknowns does not work well. In this work, we propose an Unknown-aware Deep Neural Network (UDN for short) to solve this challenging problem. The key idea of UDN is to enhance existing CNNs to support a product operation that models the product relationship among the features produced by convolutional layers. This way, missing a single key feature of a target class will greatly reduce the probability of assigning an object to this class. UDN uses a learned ensemble of these product operations, which allows it to balance the contradictory requirements of accurately classifying known objects and correctly rejecting unknowns. To further improve the performance of UDN at detecting unknowns, we propose an information-theoretic regularization strategy that incorporates the objective of rejecting unknowns into the learning process of UDN. We experiment on benchmark image datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, adding unknowns by injecting one dataset into another. Our results demonstrate that UDN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods at rejecting unknowns by 25 percentage points improvement in accuracy, while still preserving the classification accuracy.

First, sound is indicative of fine-grained object class information, e.g., sound can differentiate a metal screwdriver from a metal wrench. Second, sound also contains information about the causal effects of an action, i.e. given the sound produced, we can predict what action was applied on the object. Finally, object representations derived from audio embeddings are indicative of implicit physical properties. We demonstrate that on previously unseen objects, audio embeddings generated through interactions can predict forward models 24% better than passive visual embeddings.

For the real brain to approximate gradients, gradient information would have to be propagated separately, such that one set of synaptic weights is used for processing and another set is used for backward passes. This produces the so-called 'weight transport problem' for biological models of learning, where the backward weights used to calculate gradients need to mirror the forward weights used to process stimuli. This weight transport problem has been considered so hard that popular proposals for biological learning assume that the backward weights are simply random, as in the feedback alignment algorithm. However, such random weights do not appear to work well for large networks. Here we show how the discontinuity introduced in a spiking system can lead to a solution to this problem. The resulting algorithm is a special case of an estimator used for causal inference in econometrics, regression discontinuity design. We show empirically that this algorithm rapidly makes the backward weights approximate the forward weights. As the backward weights become correct, this improves learning performance over feedback alignment on tasks such as Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10. Our results demonstrate that a simple learning rule in a spiking network can allow neurons to produce the right backward connections and thus solve the weight transport problem.", "pdf": "/pdf/857516daf7cda3fae833c10b2e12ed6cf6094d49.pdf", "keywords": "['causal', 'inference', 'weight', 'transport', 'rdd', 'regression', 'discontinuity', 'design', 'cifar10', 'biologically', 'plausible']", "id": "rJxWxxSYvB"}, {"number": "966", "title": "Dynamics-Aware Unsupervised Discovery of Skills", "authors": "['Archit Sharma', 'Shixiang Gu', 'Sergey Levine', 'Vikash Kumar', 'Karol Hausman']", "abstract": "Conventionally, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to learn a global model for the dynamics of the environment.

Meta-learning has emerged as a promising technique for leveraging data from previous tasks to enable efficient learning of new tasks. However, most meta-learning algorithms implicitly require that the meta-training tasks be mutually-exclusive, such that no single model can solve all of the tasks at once. For example, when creating tasks for few-shot image classification, prior work uses a per-task random assignment of image classes to N-way classification labels. If this is not done, the meta-learner can ignore the task training data and learn a single model that performs all of the meta-training tasks zero-shot, but does not adapt effectively to new image classes.  This requirement means that the user must take great care in designing the tasks, for example by shuffling labels or removing task identifying information from the inputs. In some domains, this makes meta-learning entirely inapplicable. In this paper, we address this challenge by designing a meta-regularization objective using information theory that places precedence on data-driven adaptation. This causes the meta-learner to decide what must be learned from the task training data and what should be inferred from the task testing input. By doing so, our algorithm can successfully use data from non-mutually-exclusive tasks to efficiently adapt to novel tasks. We demonstrate its applicability to both contextual and gradient-based meta-learning algorithms, and apply it in practical settings where applying standard meta-learning has been difficult.

We find that traditional sequence VAEs can learn disentangled representations through their latent codes to some extent, but they often fail to properly decode when the latent factor is being manipulated, because the manipulated codes often land in holes or vacant regions in the aggregated posterior latent space, which the decoding network is not trained to process.

We present a novel and principled solution for modeling both the global absolute positions of words and their order relationships. Our solution generalizes word embeddings, previously defined as independent vectors, to continuous word functions over a variable (position). The benefit of continuous functions over variable positions is that word representations shift smoothly with increasing positions. Hence, word representations in different positions can correlate with each other in a continuous function. The general solution of these functions can be extended to complex-valued variants. We extend CNN, RNN and Transformer NNs to complex-valued versions to incorporate our complex embedding (we make all code available).

A natural question is whether a model trained with an objective to produce salient Jacobian can result in better robustness. This paper answers this question with affirmative empirical results.

By requiring only black-box access to the underlying model, randomized smoothing scales to large architectures and is agnostic to the internals of the network. However, past work on randomized smoothing has focused on restricted classes of smoothing measures or perturbations (like Gaussian or discrete) and has only been able to prove robustness with respect to simple norm bounds.

Specifically, we extend randomized smoothing procedures to handle arbitrary smoothing measures and prove robustness of the smoothed classifier by using f-divergences. Our methodology improves upon the state of the art in terms of computation time or certified robustness on several image classification tasks and an audio classification task, with respect to several classes of adversarial perturbations.

Such connections provide a unified way of viewing problems that pursue {\\em principal}, {\\em independent}, or {\\em sparse} components of high-dimensional data. Our studies reveal additional good properties of $\\ell^4$-maximization: not only is the MSP algorithm for sparse coding insensitive to small noise, but it is also robust to outliers and resilient to sparse corruptions. We provide statistical justification for such inherently nice properties. To corroborate the theoretical analysis, we also provide extensive and compelling experimental evidence with both synthetic data and real images.", "pdf": "/pdf/82f69ebb81f2a166efaed6c58908c26ecb0bde6b.pdf", "keywords": "['L4-norm Maximization', 'Robust Dictionary Learning']", "id": "SJeY-1BKDS"}, {"number": "1423", "title": "Improved Modeling of Complex Systems Using Hybrid Physics/Machine Learning/Stochastic Models", "authors": "['Anand Ramakrishnan', 'Warren B.

Stochastic input transformation methods have been proposed, where the idea is to recover the image from adversarial attack by random transformation, and to take the majority vote as consensus among the random samples. However, the transformation improves the accuracy on adversarial images at the expense of the accuracy on clean images. While it is intuitive that the accuracy on clean images would deteriorate, the exact mechanism in which how this occurs is unclear. In this paper, we study the distribution of softmax induced by stochastic transformations. We observe that with random transformations on the clean images, although the mass of the softmax distribution could shift to the wrong class, the resulting distribution of softmax could be used to correct the prediction. Furthermore, on the adversarial counterparts, with the image transformation, the resulting shapes of the distribution of softmax are similar to the distributions from the clean images. With these observations, we propose a method to improve existing transformation-based defenses. We train a separate lightweight distribution classifier to recognize distinct features in the distributions of softmax outputs of transformed images.

Surprisingly, we find that slight differences in task have no measurable effect on the visual representation for both SqueezeNet and ResNet architectures.  We then empirically demonstrate that visual representations learned on one task can be effectively transferred to a different task.  Interestingly, we show that if the tasks constrain the agent to spatially disjoint parts of the environment, differences in representation emerge for SqueezeNet models but less-so for ResNets, suggesting that ResNets feature inductive biases which encourage more task-agnostic representations, even in the context of spatially separated tasks.

This property hampers the convergence to such internal representations which are highly specific and tailored for a classifier with a particular set of parameters.

By factorizing the (rating) matrix into the product of low-dimensional latent embeddings of rows (users) and columns (items), a majority of existing matrix completion methods are transductive, since the learned embeddings cannot generalize to unseen rows/columns or to new matrices. To make matrix completion inductive, most previous works use content (side information), such as user's age or movie's genre, to make predictions. However, high-quality content is not always available, and can be hard to extract. Under the extreme setting where not any side information is available other than the matrix to complete, can we still learn an inductive matrix completion model? In this paper, we propose an Inductive Graph-based Matrix Completion (IGMC) model to address this problem. IGMC trains a graph neural network (GNN) based purely on 1-hop subgraphs around (user, item) pairs generated from the rating matrix and maps these subgraphs to their corresponding ratings. It achieves highly competitive performance with state-of-the-art transductive baselines. In addition, IGMC is inductive -- it can generalize to users/items unseen during the training (given that their interactions exist), and can even transfer to new tasks. Our transfer learning experiments show that a model trained out of the MovieLens dataset can be directly used to predict Douban movie ratings with surprisingly good performance. Our work demonstrates that: 1) it is possible to train inductive matrix completion models without using side information while achieving similar or better performances than state-of-the-art transductive methods; 2) local graph patterns around a (user, item) pair are effective predictors of the rating this user gives to the item; and 3) Long-range dependencies might not be necessary for modeling recommender systems.", "pdf": "/pdf/1e83d5f2a89ac986cdb2d0ea33544c639199d439.pdf", "keywords": "['matrix completion', 'graph neural network']", "id": "ByxxgCEYDS"}, {"number": "1540", "title": "Domain-Independent Dominance of Adaptive Methods", "authors": "['Pedro Savarese', 'David McAllester', 'Sudarshan Babu', 'Michael Maire']", "abstract": "From a simplified analysis of adaptive methods, we derive AvaGrad, a new optimizer which outperforms SGD on vision tasks when its adaptability is properly tuned.

Recently, a promising approach to this problem has been to embed KG entities as well as the query into a vector space such that entities that answer the query are embedded close to the query. However, prior work models queries as single points in the vector space, which is problematic because a complex query represents a potentially large set of its answer entities, but it is unclear how such a set can be represented as a single point. Furthermore, prior work can only handle queries that use conjunctions ($\\wedge$) and existential quantifiers ($\\exists$). Handling queries with logical disjunctions ($\\vee$) remains an open problem. Here we propose query2box, an embedding-based framework for reasoning over arbitrary queries with $\\wedge$, $\\vee$, and $\\exists$ operators in massive and incomplete KGs. Our main insight is that queries can be embedded as boxes (i.e., hyper-rectangles), where a set of points inside the box corresponds to a set of answer entities of the query. We show that conjunctions can be naturally represented as intersections of boxes and also prove a negative result that handling disjunctions would require embedding with dimension proportional to the number of KG entities. However, we show that by transforming queries into a Disjunctive Normal Form, query2box is capable of handling arbitrary logical queries with $\\wedge$, $\\vee$, $\\exists$ in a scalable manner.

A highly efficient semantic segmentation network is our platform, which achieves high segmentation accuracy at low model size and high inference speed.

Therefore, in the supervised training phase, both the segmentation network and the auxiliary network are trained using labeled images. Then, in the unsupervised training phase, the unlabeled images are segmented and a subset of image pixels are picked up by the auxiliary network; and then they are used as ground truth to train the segmentation network. Thus, at the end, all dataset images can be used for retraining the segmentation network to improve the segmentation results.

Therefore many modified normalization techniques have been proposed, which either fail to restore the performance of BN completely, or have to introduce additional nonlinear operations in inference procedure and increase huge consumption. In this paper, we reveal that there are two extra batch statistics involved in backward propagation of BN, on which has never been well discussed before.

This work introduces ``Subset Scanning methods from the anomalous pattern detection domain to the task of detecting anomalous inputs to neural networks.  Subset Scanning allows us to answer the question: '``Which subset of inputs have larger-than-expected activations at which subset of nodes?'  Framing the adversarial detection problem this way allows us to identify systematic patterns in the activation space that span multiple adversarially noised images.  Such images are ``'weird together'.  Leveraging this common anomalous pattern, we show increased detection power as the proportion of noised images increases in a test set.

One common aspect of all of these challenges is that they are by design adversarial or, technically speaking, zero-sum. In contrast to these settings, success in the real world commonly requires humans to collaborate and communicate with others, in settings that are, at least partially, cooperative. In the last year, the card game Hanabi has been established as a new benchmark environment for AI to fill this gap. In particular, Hanabi is interesting to humans since it is entirely focused on theory of mind, i.e. the ability to effectively reason over the intentions, beliefs and point of view of other agents when observing their actions. Learning to be informative when observed by others is an interesting challenge for Reinforcement Learning (RL): Fundamentally, RL requires agents to explore in order to discover good policies. However, when done naively, this randomness will inherently make their actions less informative to others during training. We present a new deep multi-agent RL method, the Simplified Action Decoder (SAD), which resolves this contradiction exploiting the centralized training phase. During training SAD allows other agents to not only observe the (exploratory) action chosen, but agents instead also observe the greedy action of their team mates.

This can be undesirable, e.g., the images can be improperly handled by search engines or recommendation systems. In this work, we propose simple approaches to improve machine interpretability of processed images: optimizing the recognition loss directly on the image processing network or through an intermediate transforming model, a process which we show can also be done in an unsupervised manner. Interestingly, the processing model's ability to enhance the recognition performance can transfer when evaluated on different recognition models, even if they are of different architectures, trained on different object categories or even different recognition tasks. This makes the solutions applicable even when we do not have the knowledge about future downstream recognition models, e.g., if we are to upload the processed images to the Internet. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three image processing tasks with two downstream recognition tasks, and confirm our method brings substantial accuracy improvement on both the same recognition model and when transferring to a different one, with minimal or no loss in the image processing quality.

However, the training and test sets may not be sufficiently representative of the empirical sample set, which consists of real-world input samples. When samples are drawn from an underrepresented or unrepresented subset during inference, the gap between the training and inference accuracies can be significant. To address this problem, we first reformulate a classification algorithm as a procedure for searching for a source code that maps input features to classes. We then derive a necessary and sufficient condition for generalization using a universal cognitive similarity metric, namely information distance, based on Kolmogorov complexity. Using this condition, we formulate an optimization problem to learn a more general classification function. To achieve this end, we extend the input features by concatenating encodings of them, and then train the classifier on the extended features. As an illustration of this idea, we focus on image classification, where we use channel codes on the input features as a systematic way to improve the degree to which the training and test sets are representative of the empirical sample set. To showcase our theoretical findings, considering that corrupted or perturbed input features belong to the empirical sample set, but typically not to the training and test sets, we demonstrate through extensive systematic experiments that, as a result of learning a more general classification function, a model trained on encoded input features is significantly more robust to common corruptions, e.g., Gaussian and shot noise, as well as adversarial perturbations, e.g., those found via projected gradient descent, than the model trained on uncoded input features.", "pdf": "/pdf/48546b850012b582b87c1dc39cc75b966a1b704e.pdf", "keywords": "['Kolmogorov complexity', 'information distance', 'generalization']", "id": "Bke7MANKvS"}, {"number": "71", "title": "InfoGraph: Unsupervised and Semi-supervised Graph-Level Representation Learning via Mutual Information Maximization", "authors": "['Fan-Yun Sun', 'Jordan Hoffman', 'Vikas Verma', 'Jian Tang']", "abstract": "This paper studies learning the representations of whole graphs in both unsupervised and semi-supervised scenarios. Graph-level representations are critical in a variety of real-world applications such as predicting the properties of molecules and community analysis in social networks. Traditional graph kernel based methods are simple, yet effective for obtaining fixed-length representations for graphs but they suffer from poor generalization due to hand-crafted designs. There are also some recent methods based on language models (e.g. graph2vec) but they tend to only consider certain substructures (e.g. subtrees) as graph representatives. Inspired by recent progress of unsupervised representation learning, in this paper we proposed a novel method called InfoGraph for learning graph-level representations. We maximize the mutual information between the graph-level representation and the representations of substructures of different scales (e.g., nodes, edges, triangles). By doing so, the graph-level representations encode aspects of the data that are shared across different scales of substructures. Furthermore, we further propose InfoGraph*, an extension of InfoGraph for semisupervised scenarios. InfoGraph* maximizes the mutual information between unsupervised graph representations learned by InfoGraph and the representations learned by existing supervised methods. As a result, the supervised encoder learns from unlabeled data while preserving the latent semantic space favored by the current supervised task.

We consider a different approach: we introduce a family of matrices called kaleidoscope matrices (K-matrices) that provably capture any structured matrix with near-optimal space (parameter) and time (arithmetic operation) complexity. We empirically validate that K-matrices can be automatically learned within end-to-end pipelines to replace hand-crafted procedures, in order to improve model quality. For example, replacing channel shuffles in ShuffleNet improves classification accuracy on ImageNet by up to 5%. K-matrices can also simplify hand-engineered pipelines---we replace filter bank feature computation in speech data preprocessing with a learnable kaleidoscope layer, resulting in only 0.4% loss in accuracy on the TIMIT speech recognition task. In addition, K-matrices can capture latent structure in models: for a challenging permuted image classification task, adding a K-matrix to a standard convolutional architecture can enable learning the latent permutation and improve accuracy by over 8 points.

We point out this may have a bad impact on adaptability of representations expressed as a minimal combined domain error. By considering the risk of compression, we show that weighting representations can align representation distributions without impacting their adaptability. This supports the claim that representation invariance is too strict a constraint. First, we introduce a new bound on the target risk that reveals a trade-off between compression and invariance of learned representations. More precisely, our results show that the adaptability of a representation can be better controlled when the compression risk is taken into account. In contrast, preserving adaptability may overestimate the risk of compression that makes the bound impracticable. We support these statements with a theoretical analysis illustrated on a standard domain adaptation benchmark. Second, we show that learning weighted representations plays a key role in relaxing the constraint of invariance and then preserving the risk of compression. Taking advantage of this trade-off may open up promising directions for the design of new adaptation methods.", "pdf": "/pdf/31abfe196eb69ac5c8adfa457db74ac1a913f6fb.pdf", "keywords": "['Domain Adaptation', 'Invariant Representation', 'Compression', 'Machine Learning Theory']", "id": "B1xGxgSYvH"}, {"number": "1989", "title": "Adversarial Filters of Dataset Biases", "authors": "['Ronan Le Bras', 'Swabha Swayamdipta', 'Chandra Bhagavatula', 'Rowan Zellers', 'Matthew Peters', 'Ashish Sabharwal', 'Yejin Choi']", "abstract": "Large-scale benchmark datasets have been among the major driving forces in AI, supporting training of models and measuring their progress. The key assumption is that these benchmarks are realistic approximations of the target tasks in the real world. However, while machine performance on these benchmarks advances rapidly --- often surpassing human performance --- it still struggles on the target tasks in the wild. This raises an important question: whether the surreal high performance on existing benchmarks are inflated due to spurious biases in them, and if so, how we can effectively revise these benchmarks to better simulate more realistic problem distributions in the real world.  \nIn this paper, we posit that while the real world problems consist of a great deal of long-tail problems, existing benchmarks are overly populated with a great deal of similar (thus non-tail) problems, which in turn, leads to a major overestimation of true AI performance. To address this challenge, we present a novel framework of Adversarial Filters to investigate model-based reduction of dataset biases. We discuss that the optimum bias reduction via AFOptimum is intractable, thus propose AFLite, an iterative greedy algorithm that adversarially filters out data points to identify a reduced dataset with more realistic problem distributions and considerably less spurious biases. \nAFLite is lightweight and can in principle be applied to any task and dataset. We apply it to popular benchmarks that are practically solved --- ImageNet and Natural Language Inference (SNLI, MNLI, QNLI) --- and present filtered counterparts as new challenge datasets where the model performance drops considerably (e.g., from 84% to 24% for ImageNet and from 92% to 62% for SNLI), while human performance remains high. An extensive suite of analysis demonstrates that AFLite effectively reduces measurable dataset biases in both the synthetic and real datasets.

This motivates us to study a problem where the representation is obtained from a classifier pre-trained on a large-scale dataset of a different domain, assuming no access to its training process, while the base class data are limited to few examples per class and their role is to adapt the representation to the domain at hand rather than learn from scratch.

However, this method was not specifically tailored for designing energy-efficient networks, and is computationally expensive on large-scale benchmarks.  In this work, we substantially improve Wu et al. (2019) in two significant ways:  1) we incorporate the energy cost of splitting different neurons to better guide the splitting process, thereby discovering more energy-efficient network architectures; 2) we substantially speed up the splitting process of Wu et al. (2019), which requires expensive eigen-decomposition, by proposing a highly scalable Rayleigh-quotient stochastic gradient algorithm.  Our fast algorithm allows us to reduce the computational cost of splitting to the same level of typical back-propagation updates and enables efficient implementation on GPU. Extensive empirical results show that our method can train highly accurate and energy-efficient networks on challenging datasets such as ImageNet,  improving a variety of baselines,  including the pruning-based methods and expert-designed architectures.", "pdf": "/pdf/56418ebfb172f22b3ae9c4aaa4d3b43bb20eac46.pdf", "keywords": "['Neural architecture optimization', 'splitting steepest descent']", "id": "BygSZAVKvr"}, {"number": "179", "title": "GDP: Generalized Device Placement for Dataflow Graphs", "authors": "['Yanqi Zhou', 'Sudip Roy', 'Amirali Abdolrashidi', 'Daniel Wong', 'Peter C.

To address both limitations, we propose an efficient end-to-end method based on a scalable sequential attention mechanism over a graph neural network that is transferable to new graphs. On a diverse set of representative deep learning models, including Inception-v3, AmoebaNet, Transformer-XL, and WaveNet, our method on average achieves 16% improvement over human experts and 9.2% improvement over the prior art with 15 times faster convergence.

We explore a novel self-supervision framework for time-series data, in which multiple auxiliary tasks (e.g., forecasting) are included to improve overall performance on a sequence-level target task without additional training data. We call this approach limited self-supervision, as we limit ourselves to only the data at-hand.

Within this framework, we introduce novel forms of self-supervision and demonstrate their utility in improving performance on the target task. Our results indicate that limited self-supervision leads to a consistent improvement over a supervised baseline, across a range of domains.

Despite MAML's popularity, a fundamental open question remains -- is the effectiveness of MAML due to the meta-initialization being primed for rapid learning (large, efficient changes in the representations) or due to feature reuse,  with the meta initialization already containing high quality features? We investigate this question, via ablation studies and analysis of the latent representations, finding that feature reuse is the dominant factor. This leads to the ANIL (Almost No Inner Loop) algorithm, a simplification of MAML where we remove the inner loop for all but the (task-specific) head of the underlying neural network. ANIL matches MAML's performance on benchmark few-shot image classification and RL and offers computational improvements over MAML. We further study the precise contributions of the head and body of the network, showing that performance on the test tasks is entirely determined by the quality of the learned features, and we can remove even the head of the network (the NIL algorithm).

Hence, some new algorithms that conduct optimizations directly in the path space (the path space is proven to be PSI) were developed, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in the path space, and it was shown that SGD in the path space is superior to that in the weight space.

Unfortunately, existing methods make this loss scale value a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned per-model, and a single scale cannot be adapted to different layers at different training stages. We introduce a loss scaling-based training method called adaptive loss scaling that makes MPT easier and more practical to use, by removing the need to tune a model-specific loss scale hyperparameter. We achieve this by introducing layer-wise loss scale values which are automatically computed during training to deal with underflow more effectively than existing methods.

The original dropout creates a randomly selected subset (called a dropout sample) from the input in each training iteration while the multi-sample dropout creates multiple dropout samples. The loss is calculated for each sample, and then the sample losses are averaged to obtain the final loss. This technique can be easily implemented without implementing a new operator by duplicating a part of the network after the dropout layer while sharing the weights among the duplicated fully connected layers.

Most algorithms are based on maximizing the likelihood, which corresponds to the M(oment)-projection of the data distribution to the model distribution.\nThe M-projection forces the model to average over modes it cannot represent. In contrast, the I(nformation)-projection ignores such modes in the data and concentrates on the modes the model can represent. Such behavior is appealing whenever we deal with highly multi-modal data where modelling single modes correctly is more important than covering all the modes. Despite this advantage, the I-projection is rarely used in practice due to the lack of algorithms that can efficiently optimize it based on data. In this work, we present a new algorithm called Expected Information Maximization (EIM) for computing the I-projection solely based on samples for general latent variable models, where we focus on Gaussian mixtures models and Gaussian mixtures of experts. Our approach applies a variational upper bound to the I-projection objective which decomposes the original objective into single objectives for each mixture component as well as for the coefficients, allowing an efficient optimization. Similar to GANs, our approach employs discriminators but uses a more stable optimization procedure, using a tight upper bound.

Instead of masking the input, our approach corrupts it by replacing some tokens with plausible alternatives sampled from a small generator network. Then, instead of training a model that predicts the original identities of the corrupted tokens, we train a discriminative model that predicts whether each token in the corrupted input was replaced by a generator sample or not. Thorough experiments demonstrate this new pre-training task is more efficient than MLM because the task is defined over all input tokens rather than just the small subset that was masked out.

The second issue is that current post-hoc explainers have only been thoroughly validated on simple models, such as linear regression, and, when applied to real-world neural networks, explainers are commonly evaluated under the assumption that the learned models behave reasonably. However, neural networks often rely on unreasonable correlations, even when producing correct decisions.

Inspired by the recent research on the use of tensor space to explain the neural network architecture, we explore the interpretable mechanism for neural language models. Specifically, we define the concept of separation rank in the language modeling process, in order to theoretically measure the degree of contextual dependencies in a sentence. Then, we show that the lower bound of such a separation rank can reveal the quantitative relation between the network structure (e.g. depth/width) and the modeling ability for the contextual dependency. Especially, increasing the depth of the neural network can be more effective to improve the ability of modeling contextual dependency. Therefore, it is important to design an adaptive network to compute the adaptive depth in a task. Inspired by Adaptive Computation Time (ACT), we design an adaptive recurrent network based on the separation rank to model contextual dependency.

Due to the stochastic nature of GAN reconstruction and the ill-posed nature of the problem, perceptual accuracy tends to correlate inversely with pixelwise accuracy which is especially detrimental to SISR, where preservation of original content is an objective. GAN stochastics can be guided by intermediate loss functions such as the VGG featurewise loss, but these features are typically derived from biased pre-trained networks. Similarly, measurements of perceptual quality such as the human Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and no-reference measures have issues with pre-trained bias. The spatial relationships between pixel values can be measured without bias using the Grey Level Co-occurence Matrix (GLCM), which was found to match the cardinality and comparative value of the MOS while reducing subjectivity and automating the analytical process. In this work, the GLCM is also directly used as a loss function to guide the generation of perceptually accurate images based on spatial collocation of pixel values. We compare GLCM based loss against scenarios where (1) no intermediate guiding loss function, and (2) the VGG feature function are used.

However, a major limitation of current IL approaches is that they learn only a single ``'average' policy based on a dataset that possibly contains demonstrations of numerous different types of behaviors. In this paper, we present a new approach called Behavioral Repertoire Imitation Learning (BRIL) that instead learns a repertoire of behaviors from a set of demonstrations by augmenting the state-action pairs with behavioral descriptions.

The deterministic subvariant's bound is equal to its objective, and the highest amongst these models. It also exhibits the best model fit in our experiments. Together, these results suggest that the predominant view of deterministic dropout as a good approximation to MC averaging is misleading. Rather, deterministic dropout is the best available approximation to the true objective.", "pdf": "/pdf/ce199f1065e5cab62a76b2618f84e1cb9b2af539.pdf", "keywords": "['dropout', 'language']", "id": "rJxwDTVFDB"}, {"number": "2034", "title": "Learning to Remember from a Multi-Task Teacher", "authors": "['Yuwen Xiong', 'Mengye Ren', 'Raquel Urtasun']", "abstract": "Recent studies on catastrophic forgetting during sequential learning typically focus on fixing the accuracy of the predictions for a previously learned task.

We thus propose to enforce the output accuracy to stay the same, we should aim to reduce the effect of catastrophic forgetting on the representation level, as the output layer can be quickly recovered later with a small number of examples. Towards this goal, we propose an experimental setup that measures the amount of representational forgetting, and develop a novel meta-learning algorithm to overcome this issue.

Dragan', 'Sergey Levine']", "abstract": "Learning to imitate expert behavior from demonstrations can be challenging, especially in environments with high-dimensional, continuous observations and unknown dynamics. Supervised learning methods based on behavioral cloning (BC) suffer from distribution shift: because the agent greedily imitates demonstrated actions, it can drift away from demonstrated states due to error accumulation. Recent methods based on reinforcement learning (RL), such as inverse RL and generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL), overcome this issue by training an RL agent to match the demonstrations over a long horizon. Since the true reward function for the task is unknown, these methods learn a reward function from the demonstrations, often using complex and brittle approximation techniques that involve adversarial training. We propose a simple alternative that still uses RL, but does not require learning a reward function. The key idea is to provide the agent with an incentive to match the demonstrations over a long horizon, by encouraging it to return to demonstrated states upon encountering new, out-of-distribution states. We accomplish this by giving the agent a constant reward of r=+1 for matching the demonstrated action in a demonstrated state, and a constant reward of r=0 for all other behavior. Our method, which we call soft Q imitation learning (SQIL), can be implemented with a handful of minor modifications to any standard Q-learning or off-policy actor-critic algorithm. Theoretically, we show that SQIL can be interpreted as a regularized variant of BC that uses a sparsity prior to encourage long-horizon imitation. Empirically, we show that SQIL outperforms BC and achieves competitive results compared to GAIL, on a variety of image-based and low-dimensional tasks in Box2D, Atari, and MuJoCo.

In this work, we illustrate the fact that existing deep architectures are hard to interpret because each hidden layer carries a mix of low level features and high level features. As a solution, we propose a novel feature leveling architecture that isolates low level features from high level features on a per-layer basis to better utilize the GLM layer in the proposed architecture for interpretation. Experimental results show that our modified models are able to achieve competitive results comparing to main-stream architectures on standard datasets while being more self-explainable.

This question has largely been studied only with respect to (worst-case) approximation error, in the more classical approximate dynamic programming literature. With regards to the statistical viewpoint, this question is largely unexplored, and the extant body of literature mainly focuses on conditions which \\emph{permit} sample efficient reinforcement learning with little understanding of what are \\emph{necessary} conditions for efficient reinforcement learning.\nThis work shows that, from the statistical viewpoint, the situation is far subtler than suggested by the more traditional approximation viewpoint, where the requirements on the representation that suffice for sample efficient RL are even more stringent. Our main results provide sharp thresholds for reinforcement learning methods, showing that there are hard limitations on what constitutes good function approximation (in terms of the dimensionality of the representation), where we focus on natural representational conditions relevant to value-based, model-based, and policy-based learning. These lower bounds highlight that having a good (value-based, model-based, or policy-based) representation in and of itself is insufficient for efficient reinforcement learning, unless the quality of this approximation passes certain hard thresholds. Furthermore, our lower bounds also imply exponential separations on the sample complexity between 1) value-based learning with perfect representation and value-based learning with a good-but-not-perfect representation, 2) value-based learning and policy-based learning, 3) policy-based learning and supervised learning and 4) reinforcement learning and imitation learning.

We learn the transition dynamics of the environment and generate a directed graph called the imaginative module. This graph encapsulates all possible trajectories that can be followed by the agent, allowing the agent to efficiently traverse through the imagined environment without ever taking any action in reality. A baseline state, which can either represent a safe or an unsafe state (based on whichever is easier to define) is taken as a human input, and the imaginative module is used to predict whether the current actions of the agent can cause it to end up in dangerous states in the future. Our imaginative module can be seen as a ``plug-and-play'' approach to ensuring safety, as it is compatible with any existing RL algorithm and any task with discrete action space.

Therefore, it is important to understand which interpolating solutions we converge to, how they depend on the initialization point and the learning algorithm, and whether they lead to different generalization performances. In this paper, we study these questions for the family of stochastic mirror descent (SMD) algorithms, of which the popular stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a special case. Recently it has been shown that, for overparameterized linear models, SMD converges to the global minimum that is closest (in terms of the Bregman divergence of the mirror used) to the initialization point, a phenomenon referred to as implicit regularization. Our contributions in this paper are both theoretical and experimental. On the theory side, we show that in the overparameterized nonlinear setting, if the initialization is close enough to the manifold of global optima, SMD with sufficiently small step size converges to a global minimum that is approximately the closest global minimum in Bregman divergence, thus attaining approximate implicit regularization. For highly overparametrized models, this closeness comes for free: the manifold of global optima is so high dimensional that with high probability an arbitrarily chosen initialization will be close to the manifold. On the experimental side, our extensive experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, using various initializations, various mirror descents, and various Bregman divergences, consistently confirms that this phenomenon indeed happens in deep learning: SMD converges to the closest global optimum to the initialization point in the Bregman divergence of the mirror used. Our experiments further indicate that there is a clear difference in the generalization performance of the solutions obtained from different SMD algorithms. Experimenting on the CIFAR-10 dataset with different regularizers, l1 to encourage sparsity, l2 (yielding SGD) to encourage small Euclidean norm, and l10 to discourage large components in the parameter vector, consistently and definitively shows that, for small initialization vectors, l10-SMD has better generalization performance than SGD, which in turn has better generalization performance than l1-SMD. This surprising, and perhaps counter-intuitive, result strongly suggests the importance of a comprehensive study of the role of regularization, and the choice of the best regularizer, to improve the generalization performance of deep networks.", "pdf": "/pdf/444d8e026eac563250dc85b773571a264ca2d12e.pdf", "keywords": "['deep learning', 'optimization', 'overparameterized', 'stochastic gradient descent', 'mirror descent']", "id": "Skeq30NFPr"}, {"number": "864", "title": "Deep symbolic regression", "authors": "['Brenden K.

In particular, a set of possible future behaviors generated by the system must be diverse to account for all possible outcomes in order to take necessary safety precautions. It is not sufficient to maintain a set of the most likely future outcomes because the set may only contain perturbations of a dominating single outcome (major mode). While generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) have been shown to be a powerful tool for learning a distribution over future trajectories, randomly drawn samples from the learned implicit likelihood model may not be diverse -- the likelihood model is derived from the training data distribution and the samples will concentrate around the major mode of the data. In this work, we propose to learn a diversity sampling function (DSF) that generates a diverse yet likely set of future trajectories. The DSF maps forecasting context features to a set of latent codes which can be decoded by a generative model (e.g., VAE) into a set of diverse trajectory samples. Concretely, the process of identifying the diverse set of samples is posed as DSF parameter estimation. To learn the parameters of the DSF, the diversity of the trajectory samples is evaluated by a diversity loss based on a determinantal point process (DPP). Gradient descent is performed over the DSF parameters, which in turn moves the latent codes of the sample set to find an optimal set of diverse yet likely trajectories.

Our cascade framework contains two architectures, i.e., Serial Style Transfer (SST) and Parallel Style Transfer (PST). The SST takes the stylized output of one method as the input content of the others. This could help improve the stylistic quality. The PST uses a shared backbone and a loss module to optimize the loss functions of different methods in parallel.

However, domain diversities between different datasets pose an evident challenge for adapting the re-ID model trained on one dataset to another one. State-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods for person re-ID transferred the learned knowledge from the source domain by optimizing with pseudo labels created by clustering algorithms on the target domain. Although they achieved state-of-the-art performances, the inevitable label noise caused by the clustering procedure was ignored. Such noisy pseudo labels substantially hinders the model's capability on further improving feature representations on the target domain. In order to mitigate the effects of noisy pseudo labels, we propose to softly refine the pseudo labels in the target domain by proposing an unsupervised framework, Mutual Mean-Teaching (MMT), to learn better features from the target domain via off-line refined hard pseudo labels and on-line refined soft pseudo labels in an alternative training manner.  In addition, the common practice is to adopt both the classification loss and the triplet loss jointly for achieving optimal performances in person re-ID models.

In this paper we introduce a novel approach to scalable semi-supervised learning, called Local Label Propagation (LLP). Extending ideas from recent work on unsupervised embedding learning, LLP first embeds datapoints, labeled and otherwise, in a common latent space using a deep neural network. It then propagates pseudolabels from known to unknown datapoints in a manner that depends on the local geometry of the embedding, taking into account both inter-point distance and local data density as a weighting on propagation likelihood. The parameters of the deep embedding are then trained to simultaneously maximize pseudolabel categorization performance as well as a metric of the clustering of datapoints within each psuedo-label group, iteratively alternating stages of network training and label propagation. We illustrate the utility of the LLP method on the ImageNet dataset, achieving results that outperform previous state-of-the-art scalable semi-supervised learning algorithms by large margins, consistently across a wide variety of training regimes.

AG-RL works by using a grammar inference algorithm to infer the action grammar' of an agent midway through training, leading to a higher-level action representation.

While learning without catastrophic failures is exceptionally difficult, prior experience can allow us to learn models that make this much easier. These models might not directly transfer to new settings, but can enable cautious adaptation that is substantially safer than na\\'{i}ve adaptation as well as learning from scratch. Building on this intuition, we propose risk-averse domain adaptation (RADA). RADA works in two steps: it first trains probabilistic model-based RL agents in a population of source domains to gain experience and capture epistemic uncertainty about the environment dynamics. Then, when dropped into a new environment, it employs a pessimistic exploration policy, selecting actions that have the best worst-case performance as forecasted by the probabilistic model.

Short of designing new RNN architectures, previous methods for dealing with this problem usually boil down to orthogonalization of the recurrent dynamics, either at initialization or during the entire training period. The basic motivation behind these methods is that orthogonal transformations are isometries of the Euclidean space, hence they preserve (Euclidean) norms and effectively deal with vanishing/exploding gradients. However, this ignores the crucial effects of non-linearity and noise. In the presence of a non-linearity, orthogonal transformations no longer preserve norms, suggesting that alternative transformations might be better suited to non-linear networks. Moreover, in the presence of noise, norm preservation itself ceases to be the ideal objective. A more sensible objective is maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the propagated signal instead. Previous work has shown that in the linear case, recurrent networks that maximize the SNR display strongly non-normal, sequential dynamics and orthogonal networks are highly suboptimal by this measure. Motivated by this finding, here we investigate the potential of non-normal RNNs, i.e. RNNs with a non-normal recurrent connectivity matrix, in sequential processing tasks. Our experimental results show that non-normal RNNs outperform their orthogonal counterparts in a diverse range of benchmarks. We also find evidence for increased non-normality and hidden chain-like feedforward motifs in trained RNNs initialized with orthogonal recurrent connectivity matrices.

However, the pre-trained language models are usually computationally expensive and memory intensive, so it is difficult to effectively execute them on resource-restricted devices. To accelerate inference and reduce model size while maintaining accuracy, we firstly propose a novel Transformer distillation method that is specially designed for knowledge distillation (KD) of the Transformer-based models. By leveraging this new KD method, the plenty of knowledge encoded in a large teacher BERT can be well transferred to a small student TinyBERT. Moreover, we introduce a new two-stage learning framework for TinyBERT, which performs Transformer distillation at both the pre-training and task-specific learning stages. This framework ensures that TinyBERT can capture the general domain as well as the task-specific knowledge in BERT. TinyBERT is empirically effective and achieves comparable results with BERT on GLUE benchmark, while being 7.5x smaller and 9.4x faster on inference.

Is generative modeling of photos a solved problem? We show that although current GANs can fit standard datasets very well, they still fall short of being comprehensive models of the visual manifold. In particular, we study their ability to fit simple transformations such as camera movements and color changes. We find that the models reflect the biases of the datasets on which they are trained (e.g., centered objects), but that they also exhibit some capacity for generalization: by 'steering' in latent space, we can shift the distribution while still creating realistic images.

While quantization to sub-byte values (i.e. precision  8 bits) has been valuable, even further quantization of MobileNets to binary or ternary values is necessary to realize significant energy savings and possibly runtime speedups on specialized hardware, such as ASICs and FPGAs. Under the key observation that convolutional filters at each layer of a deep neural network may respond differently to ternary quantization, we propose a novel quantization method that generates per-layer hybrid filter banks consisting of full-precision and ternary weight filters for MobileNets. The layer-wise hybrid filter banks essentially combine the strengths of full-precision and ternary weight filters to derive a compact, energy-efficient architecture for MobileNets. Using this proposed quantization method, we quantized a substantial portion of weight filters of MobileNets to ternary values resulting in 27.98% savings in energy, and a 51.07% reduction in the model size, while achieving comparable accuracy and no degradation in throughput on specialized hardware in comparison to the baseline full-precision MobileNets.", "pdf": "/pdf/1411dc4f885bb68f4f1081cd367870d510b56da1.pdf", "keywords": "['Model compression', 'ternary quantization', 'energy-efficient models']", "id": "S1lVhxSYPH"}, {"number": "2426", "title": "Towards Interpreting Deep Neural Networks via Understanding Layer Behaviors", "authors": "['Jiezhang Cao', 'Jincheng Li', 'Xiping Hu', 'Peilin Zhao', 'Mingkui Tan']", "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved unprecedented practical success in many applications.\nHowever, how to interpret DNNs is still an open problem.\nIn particular, what do hidden layers behave is not clearly understood. \nIn this paper, relying on a teacher-student paradigm, we seek to understand the layer behaviors of DNNs by ``monitoring' both across-layer and single-layer distribution evolution to some target distribution in the training.

Second, we train a Bayesian residual policy to improve upon the ensemble's recommendation and learn to reduce uncertainty. Our algorithm, Bayesian Residual Policy Optimization (BRPO), imports the scalability of policy gradient methods as well as the initialization from prior models.

While in principle this reward function only needs to specify the task goal, in practice reinforcement learning can be very time-consuming or even infeasible unless the reward function is shaped so as to provide a smooth gradient towards a successful outcome. This shaping is difficult to specify by hand, particularly when the task is learned from raw observations, such as images. In this paper, we study how we can automatically learn dynamical distances: a measure of the expected number of time steps to reach a given goal state from any other state. These dynamical distances can be used to provide well-shaped reward functions for reaching new goals, making it possible to learn complex tasks efficiently. We show that dynamical distances can be used in a semi-supervised regime, where unsupervised interaction with the environment is used to learn the dynamical distances, while a small amount of preference supervision is used to determine the task goal, without any manually engineered reward function or goal examples. We evaluate our method both on a real-world robot and in simulation.

However, if this policy is trained with reinforcement learning, then without a state estimator, it is hard to specify a reward function based on high-dimensional observations. To meet this challenge, we propose a simple indicator reward function for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning: we only give a positive reward when the robot's observation exactly matches a target goal observation. We show that by relabeling the original goal with the achieved goal to obtain positive rewards (Andrychowicz et al., 2017), we can learn with the indicator reward function even in continuous state spaces.

An exact algorithm to compute CNTK (Arora et al., 2019) yielded the finding that classification accuracy of CNTK on CIFAR-10 is within 6-7% of that of the corresponding CNN architecture (best figure being around 78%) which is interesting performance for a fixed kernel.\nHere we show how to significantly enhance the performance of these kernels using two ideas. (1) Modifying the kernel using a new operation called Local Average Pooling (LAP) which preserves efficient computability of the kernel and inherits the spirit of standard data augmentation using pixel shifts. Earlier papers were unable to incorporate naive data augmentation because of the quadratic training cost of kernel regression. This idea is inspired by Global Average Pooling (GAP), which we show for CNN-GP and CNTK, GAP is equivalent to full translation data augmentation. (2) Representing the input image using a pre-processing technique proposed by Coates et al. (2011), which uses a single convolutional layer composed of random image patches.\nOn CIFAR-10 the resulting kernel, CNN-GP with LAP and horizontal flip data augmentation achieves 89% accuracy, matching the performance of AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012).

The framework is based on the idea of latent variable models that represent high-dimensional observations using low-dimensional latent variables. The resulting policy consists of two levels of hierarchy: (i) a planning module that reasons a sequence of latent intentions that would lead to optimistic future and (ii) a feedback control policy, shared across the tasks, that executes the inferred intention. Because the reasoning is performed in low-dimensional latent space, the learned policy can immediately be used to solve or adapt to new tasks without additional training.

The constituents of the approximating symbol structure are defined by structural positions  roles  that can be filled by symbols. We show that when E is constructed to explicitly embed a particular type of structure (e.g., string or tree), ROLE successfully extracts the ground-truth roles defining that structure.

As the step-size converges to zero, these dynamics are defined by a nonlinear ODE which depends on the geometry of the space of function approximators, the structure of the underlying Markov chain, and their interaction. We find a set of function approximators that includes ReLU networks and has geometry amenable to TD learning regardless of environment, so that the solution performs about as well as linear TD in the worst case.

We first describe a comparatively generic agent architecture that exhibits strong performance on these tests. We then identify three aspects of the training regime and environment that make a significant difference to its performance: (a) the number of object/word experiences in the training set; (b) the visual invariances afforded by the agent's perspective, or frame of reference; and (c) the variety of visual input inherent in the perceptual aspect of the agent's perception. Our findings indicate that the degree of generalisation that networks exhibit can depend critically on particulars of the environment in which a given task is instantiated.

In this paper, we propose a new network pruning technique that generates a low-rank binary index matrix to compress index data significantly. Specifically, the proposed compression method finds a particular fine-grained pruning mask that can be decomposed into two binary matrices while decompressing index data is performed by simple binary matrix multiplication.

While effective, feature extractors like BERT may be prohibitively large for some deployment scenarios. We explore weight pruning for BERT and ask: how does compression during pre-training affect transfer learning? We find that pruning affects transfer learning in three broad regimes. Low levels of pruning (30-40%) do not affect pre-training loss or transfer to downstream tasks at all. Medium levels of pruning increase the pre-training loss and prevent useful pre-training information from being transferred to downstream tasks. High levels of pruning additionally prevent models from fitting downstream datasets, leading to further degradation.

In this paper, we develop a new strategy and self-supervised methods for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

At each vertex of the polyhedron, one of several heuristics chooses the next neighboring vertex, and these vary in accuracy and computational cost. We use deep value-based reinforcement learning to learn a pivoting strategy that at each iteration chooses between two of the most popular pivot rules -- Dantzig and steepest edge. \nBecause the latter is typically more accurate and computationally costly than the former, we assign a higher wall time-based cost to steepest edge iterations than Dantzig iterations.

The second method called  Adaptive Page-Rank is an extension of the page-rank algorithm, where nodes that have a low probability of being reached by random walks from tagged nodes are selected. We show that the latter is optimal when the fraction of tagged nodes is low, and when this fraction grows to one over the average degree, the regional uncertainty performs better than all existing methods.

We use geometric properties of determinantal varieties to derive new results on the landscape of linear networks with different loss functions and different parameterizations. Our analysis clearly illustrates that the absence of 'bad' local minima in the loss landscape of linear networks is due to two distinct phenomena that apply in different settings: it is true for arbitrary smooth convex losses in the case of architectures that can express all linear maps ('filling architectures') but it holds only for the quadratic loss when the functional space is a determinantal variety ('non-filling architectures').

To address this, we propose an end-to-end trainable encoder-decoder network for summarizing interleaved posts. The interleaved posts are encoded hierarchically, i.e., word-to-word (words in a post) followed by post-to-post (posts in a channel). The decoder also generates summaries hierarchically, thread-to-thread (generate thread representations) followed by word-to-word (i.e., generate summary words).

In this paper, we propose to scale up ensemble Active Learning methods to perform acquisition at a large scale (10k to 500k samples at a time). We do this with ensembles of hundreds of models, obtained at a minimal computational cost by reusing intermediate training checkpoints.

Several variance reduction algorithms, such as SVRG, introduce control variates to obtain a lower variance gradient estimate and faster convergence.

The traditional asymptotic analysis in stochastic optimization provides limited insight into training deep learning models under a fixed number of epochs.

For instance, to fool the discriminator, a generative adversarial network (GAN) exclusively trained to transform images of black-haired *men* to blond-haired *men* would need to change gender-related characteristics as well as hair color when given images of black-haired *women* as input. This is problematic, as often it is possible to obtain *a* pair of (source, target) distributions but then have a second source distribution where the target distribution is unknown. The computational challenge is that generative models are good at generation within the manifold of the data that they are trained on. However, generating new samples outside of the manifold or extrapolating 'out-of-sample' is a much harder problem that has been less well studied. To address this, we introduce a technique called *neuron editing* that learns how neurons encode an edit for a particular transformation in a latent space. We use an autoencoder to decompose the variation within the dataset into activations of different neurons and generate transformed data by defining an editing transformation on those neurons. By performing the transformation in a latent trained space, we encode fairly complex and non-linear transformations to the data with much simpler distribution shifts to the neuron's activations.

In this paper, we aim to provide a theoretical understanding on what mainly helps with the distillation. Our answer is 'early stopping'. Assuming that the teacher network is overparameterized, we argue that the teacher network is essentially harvesting dark knowledge from the data via early stopping. This can be justified by a new concept, Anisotropic In- formation Retrieval (AIR), which means that the neural network tends to fit the informative information first and the non-informative information (including noise) later. Motivated by the recent development on theoretically analyzing overparame- terized neural networks, we can characterize AIR by the eigenspace of the Neural Tangent Kernel(NTK). AIR facilities a new understanding of distillation. With that, we further utilize distillation to refine noisy labels. We propose a self-distillation al- gorithm to sequentially distill knowledge from the network in the previous training epoch to avoid memorizing the wrong labels. We also demonstrate, both theoret- ically and empirically, that self-distillation can benefit from more than just early stopping.

In standard SGD, parameters are updated by improving along the path of the gradient at the current iterate on a batch of examples, where the addition of a ``momentum'' term biases the update in the direction of the previous change in parameters. In non-stochastic convex optimization one can show that a momentum adjustment provably reduces convergence time in many settings, yet such results have been elusive in the stochastic and non-convex settings. At the same time, a widely-observed empirical phenomenon is that in training deep networks stochastic momentum appears to significantly improve convergence time, variants of it have flourished in the development of other popular update methods, e.g. ADAM, AMSGrad, etc. Yet theoretical justification for the use of stochastic momentum has remained a significant open question. In this paper we propose an answer: stochastic momentum improves deep network training because it modifies SGD to escape saddle points faster and, consequently, to more quickly find a second order stationary point.

This approach, while efficient and widely used, imposes a security vulnerability because the pre-trained model used in transfer learning is usually publicly available, including to potential attackers. In this paper, we show that without any additional knowledge other than the pre-trained model, an attacker can launch an effective and efficient brute force attack that can craft instances of input to trigger each target class with high confidence. We assume that the attacker has no access to any target-specific information, including samples from target classes, re-trained model, and probabilities assigned by Softmax to each class, and thus making the attack target-agnostic.

In this paper we reassess popular bonus-based exploration methods within a common evaluation framework. We combine Rainbow (Hessel et al., 2018) with different exploration bonuses and evaluate its performance on Montezuma's Revenge, Bellemare et al.'s set of hard of exploration games with sparse rewards, and the whole Atari 2600 suite. We find that while exploration bonuses lead to higher score on Montezuma's Revenge they do not provide meaningful gains over the simpler epsilon-greedy scheme. In fact, we find that methods that perform best on that game often underperform epsilon-greedy on easy exploration Atari 2600 games. We find that our conclusions remain valid even when hyperparameters are tuned for these easy-exploration games. Finally, we find that none of the methods surveyed benefit from additional training samples (1 billion frames, versus Rainbow's 200 million) on Bellemare et al.'s hard exploration games.

Our key idea is that a good guiding principle for intrinsic motivation in synergistic tasks is to take actions which affect the world in ways that would not be achieved if the agents were acting on their own. Thus, we propose to incentivize agents to take (joint) actions whose effects cannot be predicted via a composition of the predicted effect for each individual agent. We study two instantiations of this idea, one based on the true states encountered, and another based on a dynamics model trained concurrently with the policy.

As networks grow in size and complexity one approach  of  reducing  training  time  is  the  use  of  low-precision  data  representation and computations during the training stage.  However, in doing so the final accuracy suffers due to the problem of vanishing gradients.  Existing state-of-the-art methods combat this issue by means of a mixed-precision approach employing two different precision levels, FP32 (32-bit floating-point precision) and FP16/FP8 (16-/8-bit floating-point precision), leveraging the hardware support of recent GPU architectures for FP16 operations to obtaining performance gains. This work pushes the boundary of quantised training by employing a multilevel optimisation approach that utilises multiple precisions including low-precision fixed-point representations.  The training strategy, named MuPPET, combines the use of  multiple  number  representation regimes  together  with  a  precision-switching mechanism that decides at run time the transition between different precisions. Overall, the proposed strategy tailors the training process to the hardware-level capabilities of the utilised hardware architecture and yields improvements in training time and energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Interpreting the top layers as a classifier and the lower layers a feature extractor, one can hypothesize that unwanted network convergence may occur when the classifier has overfit with respect to the feature extractor. This can lead to the feature extractor being under-trained, possibly failing to learn much about the patterns in the input data. To address this we propose a good classifier hypothesis: given a fixed classifier that partitions the space well, the feature extractor can be further trained to fit that classifier and learn the data patterns well.  This alleviates the problem of under-training the feature extractor and enables the network to learn patterns in the data with small partial derivatives.  We verify this hypothesis empirically and propose a novel top-down training method. We train all layers jointly, obtaining a good classifier from the top layers, which are then frozen. Following re-initialization, we retrain the bottom layers with respect to the frozen classifier.  Applying this approach to a set of speech recognition experiments using the Wall Street Journal and noisy CHiME-4 datasets we observe substantial accuracy gains.

The augmentation policy network attempts to increase the training loss of a target network through generating adversarial augmentation policies, while the target network can learn more robust features from harder examples to improve the generalization.

In recent years, stereo matching algorithms based on deep learning have achieved excellent performance and become the mainstream research direction. Existing algorithms generally use deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to extract more abstract semantic information, but we believe that the detailed information of the spatial structure is more important for stereo matching tasks. Based on this point of view, this paper proposes a shallow feature extraction network with a large receptive field. The network consists of three parts: a primary feature extraction module, an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module and a feature fusion module. The primary feature extraction network contains only three convolution layers. This network utilizes the basic feature extraction ability of the shallow network to extract and retain the detailed information of the spatial structure. In this paper, the dilated convolution and atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module is introduced to increase the size of receptive field. In addition, a feature fusion module is designed, which integrates the feature maps with multiscale receptive fields and mutually complements the feature information of different scales. We replaced the feature extraction part of the existing stereo matching algorithms with our shallow feature extraction network, and achieved state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI 2015 dataset.

We further extended the model and the algorithm to an unsupervised setting where only the input representation of the samples is available. In a series of empirical evaluation on similarity search tasks, the proposed models reported significantly improved results over the state-of-the-art methods in both search accuracy and running time.

The challenge is that clinical data (i.e. patients) with drug response outcome is very limited, creating a need for transfer learning to bridge the gap between large pre-clinical pharmacogenomics datasets (e.g. cancer cell lines) and clinical datasets.

Building atop the baseline, we then make the following novel contributions in our work:\n(i) We argue that the definition of error-potentials is generalizable across different environments; specifically we show that error-potentials of an observer can be learned for a specific game, and the definition used as-is for another game without requiring re-learning of the error-potentials.  \n(ii) We propose two different frameworks to combine recent advances in DRL into the error-potential based feedback system in a sample-efficient manner, allowing humans to provide implicit feedback while training in the loop, or prior to the training of the RL agent.\n(iii) Finally, we scale the implicit human feedback (via ErrP) based RL to reasonably complex environments (games) and demonstrate the significance of our approach through synthetic and real user experiments.\n", "pdf": "/pdf/44cda98831ea9ff4ea352a0b5970ebf2ff94b609.pdf", "keywords": "['Error-Potentials', 'Implicit Human Feedback', 'Deep Reinforcement Learning', 'Human-assistance']", "id": "rJgDT04twH"}, {"number": "284", "title": "AutoGrow: Automatic Layer Growing in Deep Convolutional Networks", "authors": "['Wei Wen', 'Feng Yan', 'Hai Li']", "abstract": "Depth is a key component of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), however, designing depth is heuristic and requires many human efforts.

The next step is to achieve better generalization to natural (or non-adversarial) perturbations as well as known pixel-wise adversarial perturbations of inputs. Previous work has studied generalization to natural geometric transformations (e.g., rotations) as invariance, and generalization to adversarial perturbations as robustness. In this paper, we examine the interplay between invariance and robustness. We empirically study the following two cases:(a) change in adversarial robustness as we improve only the invariance using equivariant models and training augmentation, (b) change in invariance as we improve only the adversarial robustness using adversarial training. We observe that the rotation invariance of equivariant models (StdCNNs and GCNNs) improves by training augmentation with progressively larger rotations but while doing so, their adversarial robustness does not improve, or worse, it can even drop significantly on datasets such as MNIST. As a plausible explanation for this phenomenon we observe that the average perturbation distance of the test points to the decision boundary decreases as the model learns larger and larger rotations. On the other hand, we take adversarially trained LeNet and ResNet models which have good \\ell_\\infty adversarial robustness on MNIST and CIFAR-10, and observe that adversarially training them with progressively larger norms keeps their rotation invariance essentially unchanged. In fact, the difference between test accuracy on unrotated test data and on randomly rotated test data upto \\theta , for all \\theta in [0, 180], remains essentially unchanged after adversarial training . As a plausible explanation for the observed phenomenon we show empirically that the principal components of adversarial perturbations and perturbations given by small rotations are nearly orthogonal", "pdf": "/pdf/9684203b65014ca3118e3028b4a62eb222593d8d.pdf", "keywords": "['Invariance', 'Adversarial', 'Robustness']", "id": "HJxp9kBFDS"}, {"number": "158", "title": "Intensity-Free Learning of Temporal Point Processes", "authors": "['Oleksandr Shchur', 'Marin Bilo\u0161', 'Stephan G\u00fcnnemann']", "abstract": "Temporal point processes are the dominant paradigm for modeling sequences of events happening at irregular intervals.

To accelerate our simulation, we show that using a special implementation of the integrate-and-fire neuron allows us to describe the accumulated activations and errors of the spiking neural network in terms of an equivalent artificial neural network, allowing us to largely speed up training compared to an explicit simulation of all spike events. This way we are able to demonstrate that even for deep networks, the gradients can be discretized sufficiently well with spikes if the gradient is properly rescaled.

Unfortunately, IWAE crucially relies on the availability of reparametrisations and even if these exist, the multi-sample objective leads to inference-network gradients which break down as $K$ is increased (Rainforth et al., 2018). This breakdown can only be circumvented by removing high-variance score-function terms, either by heuristically ignoring them (which yields the 'sticking-the-landing' IWAE (IWAE-STL) gradient from Roeder et al.

However, in previous work, the mixup-trained models only passively defend adversarial attacks in inference by directly classifying the inputs, where the induced global linearity is not well exploited.

Existing NAT models usually rely on the technique of knowledge distillation, which creates the training data from a pretrained autoregressive model for better performance. Knowledge distillation is empirically useful, leading to large gains in accuracy for NAT models, but the reason for this success has, as of yet, been unclear. In this paper, we first design systematic experiments to investigate why knowledge distillation is crucial to NAT training. We find that knowledge distillation can reduce the complexity of data sets and help NAT to model the variations in the output data. Furthermore, a strong correlation is observed between the capacity of an NAT model and the optimal complexity of the distilled data for the best translation quality. Based on these findings, we further propose several approaches that can alter the complexity of data sets to improve the performance of NAT models.

Among them, one of the state-of-the-art approaches (Cheng et al., 2019) showed that hard-label attack can be modeled as an optimization problem where the objective function can be evaluated by binary search with additional model queries, thereby a zeroth order optimization algorithm can be applied.

Although, classical results suggest that it is asymptotically optimal to separate the sub-tasks of compression (source coding) and error correction (channel coding), it is well known that for finite block-length problems, and when there are restrictions to the computational complexity of coding, this optimality may not be achieved. Thus, we empirically compare the performance of joint and separate systems, and conclude that joint systems outperform their separate counterparts when coding is performed by flexible learnable function approximators such as neural networks.  Specifically, we cast the joint communication problem as a variational learning problem. To facilitate this, we introduce a differentiable and computationally efficient version of this channel.

The resultant neural network based on such weight sharing scheme, termed Filter Summary CNNs or FSNet, has a FS in each convolution layer instead of a set of independent filters in the conventional convolution layer. FSNet has the same architecture as that of the baseline CNN to be compressed, and each convolution layer of FSNet has the same number of filters from FS as that of the basline CNN in the forward process. With compelling computational acceleration ratio, the parameter space of FSNet is much smaller than that of the baseline CNN. In addition, FSNet is quantization friendly. FSNet with weight quantization leads to even higher compression ratio without noticeable performance loss. We further propose Differentiable FSNet where the way filters share weights is learned in a differentiable and end-to-end manner.

Such challenges range from spurious associations of confounding variables in medical studies to the bias of race in gender or face recognition systems. One solution is to enhance datasets and organize them such that they do not reflect biases, which is a cumbersome and intensive task. The alternative is to make use of available data and build models considering these biases. Traditional statistical methods apply straightforward techniques such as residualization or stratification to precomputed features to account for confounding variables. However, these techniques are not in general applicable to end-to-end deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose a method based on the adversarial training strategy to learn discriminative features unbiased and invariant to the confounder(s). This is enabled by incorporating a new adversarial loss function that encourages a vanished correlation between the bias and learned features.

Prior work on video generation largely focuses on prediction models that only observe frames from the beginning of the video. GCP instead treats videos as start-goal transformations, making video generation easier by conditioning on the more informative context provided by the first and final frames.  Not only do existing forward prediction approaches synthesize better and longer videos when modified to become goal-conditioned,  but GCP models can also utilize structures that are not linear in time, to accomplish hierarchical prediction. To this end, we study both auto-regressive GCP models and novel tree-structured GCP models that generate frames recursively, splitting the video iteratively into finer and finer segments delineated by subgoals. In experiments across simulated and real datasets, our GCP methods generate high-quality sequences over long horizons.  Tree-structured GCPs are also substantially easier to parallelize than auto-regressive GCPs, making training  and  inference  very  efficient, and allowing the model to train on sequences that are thousands of frames in length.Finally, we demonstrate the utility of GCP approaches for imitation learning in the setting without access to expert actions.

DIH is a property of each training sample and is computed as the running mean of the sample's instantaneous hardness as measured over the training history. We use DIH to evaluate how well a model retains knowledge about each training sample over time. We find that for deep neural nets (DNNs), the DIH of a sample in relatively early training stages reflects its DIH in later stages and as a result, DIH can be effectively used to reduce the set of training samples in future epochs. Specifically, during each epoch, only samples with high DIH are trained (since they are historically hard) while samples with low DIH can be safely ignored. DIH is updated each epoch only for the selected samples, so it does not require additional computation. Hence, using DIH during training leads to an appreciable speedup. Also, since the model is focused on the historically more challenging samples, resultant models are more accurate. The above, when formulated as an algorithm, can be seen as a form of curriculum learning, so we call our framework DIH curriculum learning (or DIHCL). The advantages of DIHCL, compared to other curriculum learning approaches, are: (1) DIHCL does not require additional inference steps over the data not selected by DIHCL in each epoch, (2) the dynamic instance hardness, compared to static instance hardness (e.g., instantaneous loss), is more stable as it integrates information over the entire training history up to the present time. Making certain mathematical assumptions, we formulate the problem of DIHCL as finding a curriculum that maximizes a multi-set function $f(\\cdot)$, and derive an approximation bound for a DIH-produced curriculum relative to the optimal curriculum. Empirically, DIHCL-trained DNNs significantly outperform random mini-batch SGD and other recently developed curriculum learning methods in terms of efficiency, early-stage convergence, and final performance, and this is shown in training several state-of-the-art DNNs on 11 modern datasets.", "pdf": "/pdf/ea6e953e80c6ba43965e21841dfd41319b4c4345.pdf", "keywords": "['training dynamics', 'instance hardness', 'curriculum learning', 'neural nets memorization']", "id": "H1lXVJStwB"}, {"number": "1737", "title": "Deep Lifetime Clustering", "authors": "['S Chandra Mouli', 'Leonardo Teixeira', 'Jennifer Neville', 'Bruno Ribeiro']", "abstract": "The goal of lifetime clustering is to develop an inductive model that maps subjects into $K$ clusters according to their underlying (unobserved) lifetime distribution.

In this work, we perform a  global analysis of GANs from two perspectives:  the global landscape of the outer-optimization problem and the global behavior of the gradient descent dynamics.

These results either assume that the activation function is ReLU or they depend on the minimum eigenvalue of a certain Gram matrix. In the latter case, existing works only prove that this minimum eigenvalue is non-zero and do not provide quantitative bounds which require that this eigenvalue be large. Empirically, a number of alternative activation functions have been proposed which tend to perform better than ReLU at least in some settings but no clear understanding has emerged. This state of affairs underscores the importance of theoretically understanding the impact of activation functions on training. In the present paper, we provide theoretical results about the effect of activation function on the training of highly overparametrized 2-layer neural networks. A crucial property that governs the performance of an activation is whether or not it is smooth: \n For non-smooth activations such as ReLU, SELU, ELU, which are not smooth because there is a point where either the first order or second order derivative is discontinuous, all eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix are large under minimal assumptions on the data. \n For smooth activations such as tanh, swish, polynomial, which have derivatives of all orders at all points, the situation is more complex: if the subspace spanned by the data has small dimension then the minimum eigenvalue of the Gram matrix can be small leading to slow training. But if the dimension is large and the data satisfies another mild condition, then the eigenvalues are large. If we allow deep networks, then the small data dimension is not a limitation provided that the depth is sufficient. \nWe discuss a number of extensions and applications of these results.", "pdf": "/pdf/fbbea6ca741f5700e790389e48dc9245d16dbca9.pdf", "keywords": "['activation functions', 'deep learning theory', 'neural networks']", "id": "rkgfdeBYvH"}, {"number": "1774", "title": "QXplore: Q-Learning Exploration by Maximizing Temporal Difference Error", "authors": "['Riley Simmons-Edler', 'Ben Eisner', 'Daniel Yang', 'Anthony Bisulco', 'Eric Mitchell', 'Sebastian Seung', 'Daniel Lee']", "abstract": "A major challenge in reinforcement learning is exploration, especially when reward landscapes are sparse.

TPO takes a hybrid approach to policy optimization.  Building the MCTS tree in a continuous action space and updating the policy gradient using off-policy MCTS trajectories are non-trivial. To overcome these challenges, we propose limiting tree search branching factor by drawing only few action samples from the policy distribution and define a new loss function based on the trajectories mean and standard deviations.  Our approach led to some non-intuitive findings.  MCTS training generally requires a large number of samples and simulations. However, we observed that bootstrappingtree search with a pre-trained policy allows us to achieve high quality results with a low MCTS branching factor and few number of simulations. Without the proposed policy bootstrapping, continuous MCTS would require a much larger branching factor and simulation count, rendering it computationally and prohibitively expensive.

As far as the learning algorithm is concerned, these rewards are typically given and immutable. In this paper we instead consider the proposition that the reward function itself may be a good locus of knowledge. This is consistent with a common use, in the literature, of hand-designed intrinsic rewards to improve the learning dynamics of an agent. We adopt a multi-lifetime setting of the Optimal Rewards Framework, and investigate how meta-learning can be used to find good reward functions in a data-driven way. To this end, we propose to meta-learn an intrinsic reward function that allows agents to maximise their extrinsic rewards accumulated until the end of their lifetimes.

Our approach follows the general strategy of Generative Adversarial Networks, where an image generator network learns to create image samples that are realistic enough to fool a discriminator network into believing that they are natural images. In contrast, in our approach the image gen- eration is split into 2 stages. In the first stage a generator network outputs 3D ob- jects.

The key observation is that a realistic 3D object should yield a realistic rendering from any plausible viewpoint. Thus, by randomizing the choice of the viewpoint our proposed training forces the generator network to learn an interpretable 3D representation disentangled from the viewpoint.

Therefore, much work has focused on speeding them up by reducing the variance of the estimated gradient or choosing better stepsizes. An alternative strategy would be to select a carefully chosen subset of training data, train only on that subset, and hence speed up optimization. However, it remains an open question how to achieve this, both theoretically as well as practically, while not compromising on the quality of the final model.  Here we develop CRAIG, a method for selecting a weighted subset (or coreset) of training data in order to speed up IG methods. We prove that by greedily selecting a subset S of training data that minimizes the upper-bound on the estimation error of the full gradient, running IG on this subset will converge to the (near)optimal solution in the same number of epochs as running IG on the full data. But because at each epoch the gradients are computed only on the subset S, we obtain a speedup that is inversely proportional to the size of S. Our subset selection algorithm is fully general and can be applied to most IG methods. We further demonstrate practical effectiveness of our algorithm, CRAIG, through an extensive set of experiments on several applications, including logistic regression and deep neural networks. Experiments show that CRAIG, while achieving practically the same loss, speeds up IG methods by up to 10x for convex and 3x for non-convex (deep learning) problems.", "pdf": "/pdf/31a80d3d1fe829f5a25f8631ea97de012bb0ca78.pdf", "keywords": "[]", "id": "SygRikHtvS"}, {"number": "660", "title": "Representation Quality Explain Adversarial Attacks", "authors": "['Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas', 'Shashank Kotyan', 'Moe Matsuki']", "abstract": "Neural networks have been shown vulnerable to adversarial samples.  Slightly perturbed input images are able to change the classification of accurate models, showing that the representation learned is not as good as previously thought. To aid the development of better neural networks, it would be important to evaluate to what extent are current neural networks' representations capturing the existing features. Here we propose a way to evaluate the representation quality of neural networks using a novel type of zero-shot test, entitled Raw Zero-Shot. The main idea lies in the fact that some features are present on unknown classes and that unknown classes can be defined as a combination of previous learned features without representation bias (a bias towards representation that maps only current set of input-outputs and their boundary). To evaluate the soft-labels of unknown classes, two metrics are proposed. One is based on clustering validation techniques (Davies-Bouldin Index) and the other is based on soft-label distance of a given correct soft-label.\nExperiments show that such metrics are in accordance with the robustness to adversarial attacks and might serve as a guidance to build better models as well as be used in loss functions to create new types of neural networks. Interestingly, the results suggests that dynamic routing networks such as CapsNet have better representation while current deeper DNNs are trading off representation quality for accuracy.", "pdf": "/pdf/0243086c701181aeb1367afb513b390272628621.pdf", "keywords": "['Representation Metrics', 'Adversarial Machine Learning', 'One-Pixel Attack', 'DeepFool', 'CapsNet']", "id": "SklfY6EFDH"}, {"number": "7", "title": "Improving Evolutionary Strategies with Generative Neural Networks", "authors": "['Louis Faury', 'Cl\u00e9ment Calauz\u00e8nes', 'Olivier Fercoq']", "abstract": "Evolutionary Strategies (ES) are a popular family of black-box zeroth-order optimization algorithms which rely on search distributions to efficiently optimize a large variety of objective functions.

On the other hand, model-based planning methods learn and adapt quickly, but require prohibitive levels of computational resources. Under constrained computation limits, the agent must allocate its resources wisely, which requires the agent to understand both its own performance and the current state of the environment: knowing that its mastery over control in the current dynamics is poor, the agent should dedicate more time to planning. We present a new algorithm, Adaptive Online Planning (AOP), that achieves strong performance in this setting by combining model-based planning with model-free learning. By measuring the performance of the planner and the uncertainty of the model-free components, AOP is able to call upon more extensive planning only when necessary, leading to reduced computation times.

This motivates investigating joint learning methods which can overcome this impediment, by simultaneously learning embeddings across languages via a cross-lingual term in the training objective. Given the abundance of parallel data available (Tiedemann, 2012), we propose a bilingual extension of the CBOW method which leverages sentence-aligned corpora to obtain robust cross-lingual word and sentence representations.

We first present an empirical study on the robustness of the neural ODE-based networks (ODENets) by exposing them to inputs with various types of perturbations and subsequently investigating the changes of the corresponding outputs. In contrast to conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we find that the ODENets are more robust against both random Gaussian perturbations and adversarial attack examples. We then provide an insightful understanding of this phenomenon by exploiting a certain desirable property of the flow of a continuous-time ODE, namely that integral curves are non-intersecting. Our work suggests that, due to their intrinsic robustness, it is promising to use neural ODEs as a basic block for building robust deep network models. To further enhance the robustness of vanilla neural ODEs, we propose the time-invariant steady neural ODE (TisODE), which regularizes the flow on perturbed data via the time-invariant property and the imposition of a steady-state constraint.

In this work, we first empirically show that self-training is able to decently improve the supervised baseline on neural sequence generation tasks. Through careful examination of the performance gains, we find that the perturbation on the hidden states (i.e. dropout) is critical for self-training to benefit from the pseudo-parallel data, which acts as a regularizer and forces the model to yield close predictions for similar unlabeled inputs. Such effect helps the model correct some incorrect predictions on unlabeled data.

Recent work proposed identifiable generative modelling using variational autoencoders (iVAE) with a theory of identifiability.

We evaluate our model using a novel dataset of synthetic reaching tasks inspired by the cognitive sciences and behavioural ecology. In doing so we examine the model's ability to imagine tools for increasingly complex scenario types, beyond those seen during training.

Deep features appear general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Such property is in prevalent use in real-world applications. A neural network pretrained on large datasets, such as ImageNet, can significantly boost generalization and accelerate training if fine-tuned to a smaller target dataset. Despite its pervasiveness, few effort has been devoted to uncovering the reason of transferability in deep feature representations. This paper tries to understand transferability from the perspectives of improved generalization, optimization and the feasibility of transferability. We demonstrate that 1) Transferred models tend to find flatter minima, since their weight matrices stay close to the original flat region of pretrained parameters when transferred to a similar target dataset; 2) Transferred representations make the loss landscape more favorable with improved Lipschitzness, which accelerates and stabilizes training substantially. The improvement largely attributes to the fact that the principal component of gradient is suppressed in the pretrained parameters, thus stabilizing the magnitude of gradient in back-propagation. 3) The feasibility of transferability is related to the similarity of both input and label. And a surprising discovery is that the feasibility is also impacted by the training stages in that the transferability first increases during training, and then declines.

Our key idea is to use a GP formulation of deep networks, enabling us to both identify the memorable past and regularise over them. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and opens a new direction for life-long learning where regularisation methods are naturally combined with memory-based methods.", "pdf": "/pdf/f7b24c76287928b14b9ddd3101285d05934d1a02.pdf", "keywords": "['Continual learning', 'deep learning', 'functional regularisation']", "id": "r1xjgxBFPB"}, {"number": "1375", "title": "Non-linear System Identification from Partial Observations via Iterative Smoothing and Learning", "authors": "['Kunal Menda', 'Jean de Becdeli\u00e8vre', 'Jayesh K Gupta', 'Ilan Kroo', 'Mykel J.

This paper develops the DeepXML algorithm which addresses both limitations by introducing a novel architecture that splits training of head and tail labels.  DeepXML increases accuracy by (a) learning word embeddings on head labels and transferring them through a novel residual connection to data impoverished tail labels; (b) increasing the amount of negative training data available by extending state-of-the-art negative sub-sampling techniques; and (c) re-ranking the set of predicted labels to eliminate the hardest negatives for the original classifier. All of these contributions are implemented efficiently by extending the highly scalable Slice algorithm for pretrained embeddings to learn the proposed DeepXML architecture. As a result, DeepXML could efficiently scale to problems involving millions of labels that were beyond the pale of state-of-the-art deep extreme classifiers as it could be more than 10x faster at training than XML-CNN and AttentionXML.

The intention of this approach is to handle sentiment terms specific to Amharic language from Amharic Corpus. Small set of seed terms are manually prepared from three parts of speech such as noun, adjective and verb. We developed algorithms for constructing Amharic sentiment lexicons automatically from Amharic news corpus.

Using this matrix, we computed the cosine distance of mean vector of seed lists and each word in the corpus vocabulary. Based on the threshold value, the top closest words to the mean vector of seed list are added to the lexicon. Then the mean vector of the new sentiment seed list is updated and process is repeated until we get sufficient terms in the lexicon. Using PPMI with threshold value of 100 and 200, we got corpus based Amharic Sentiment lexicons of size 1811 and 3794 respectively by expanding 519 seeds.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep unfolding method that explores reweighted minimization. Due to the underlying reweighted minimization model, our RNN has a different soft-thresholding function (alias, different activation function) for each hidden unit in each layer. Furthermore, it has higher network expressivity than existing deep unfolding RNN models due to the over-parameterizing weights.

This update is strikingly analogous to the popular Straight Through Estimator (STE) based method which is typically viewed as a trick to avoid vanishing gradients issue but here we show that it is an implementation method for MD for certain projections.

However, it is challenging to reconstruct novel architectures and pipelines without knowing the computational graph (e.g., the layers, branches or skip connections), the architectural parameters (e.g., the number of filters in a convolutional layer) or the specific pre-processing steps (e.g. embeddings). In this paper, we design an algorithm that reconstructs the key components of a novel deep learning system by exploiting a small amount of information leakage from a cache side-channel attack, Flush+Reload. We use Flush+Reload to infer the trace of computations and the timing for each computation. Our algorithm then generates candidate computational graphs from the trace and eliminates incompatible candidates through a parameter estimation process.

This is relevant in settings such as medical diagnosis, where a classifier trained to predict disease based on observed symptoms may need to be adapted to a different distribution where the baseline frequency of the disease is higher. Given estimates of p(y|x) from a predictive model, one can apply domain adaptation procedures including Expectation Maximization (EM) and Black-Box Shift Estimation (BBSE) to efficiently correct for the difference in class proportions between the training and test distributions. Unfortunately, modern neural networks typically fail to produce well-calibrated estimates of p(y|x), reducing the effectiveness of these approaches. In recent years, Temperature Scaling has emerged as an efficient approach to combat miscalibration. However, the effectiveness of Temperature Scaling in the context of adaptation to label shift has not been explored. In this work, we study the impact of various calibration approaches on shift estimates produced by EM or BBSE. In experiments with image classification and diabetic retinopathy detection, we find that calibration consistently tends to improve shift estimation.

These approaches are supervised; a predictive task with ground-truth labels is used to drive the learning. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach, \\textsc{BayesPool}, with the use of variational Bayes. It produces graph representations given a predefined hierarchy.

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive surveying view of applying GNN-based embeddings to 2QBF problems and aims to offer insights in applying machine learning tools to more complicated symbolic reasoning problems.\n", "pdf": "/pdf/15e242462984ff169e630d8595ca5336cae63ebd.pdf", "keywords": "['Graph Neural Networks', '2-Quantified Boolean Formula', 'Symbolic Reasoning']", "id": "SJl28R4YPr"}, {"number": "109", "title": "PROTOTYPE-ASSISTED ADVERSARIAL LEARNING FOR UNSUPERVISED DOMAIN ADAPTATION", "authors": "['Dapeng Hu', 'Jian Liang*', 'Qibin Hou', 'Hanshu Yan', 'Jiashi Feng']", "abstract": "This paper presents a generic framework to tackle the crucial class mismatch problem in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for multi-class distributions.  Previous adversarial learning methods condition domain alignment only on pseudo labels, but noisy and inaccurate pseudo labels may perturb the multi-class distribution embedded in probabilistic predictions, hence bringing insufficient alleviation to the latent mismatch problem.  Compared with pseudo labels, class prototypes are more accurate and reliable since they summarize over all the instances and are  able  to  represent  the  inherent  semantic  distribution  shared  across  domains. Therefore, we propose a novel Prototype-Assisted Adversarial Learning (PAAL) scheme, which incorporates instance probabilistic predictions and class prototypes together  to  provide  reliable  indicators  for  adversarial  domain  alignment.   With the PAAL scheme,  we align both the instance feature representations and class prototype  representations  to  alleviate  the  mismatch  among  semantically  different classes.   Also,  we exploit the class prototypes as proxy to minimize the within-class variance in the target domain to mitigate the mismatch among semantically similar classes.  With these novelties, we constitute a Prototype-Assisted Conditional Domain Adaptation (PACDA) framework which well tackles the class mismatch problem. We demonstrate the good performance and generalization ability of the PAAL scheme and also PACDA framework on two UDA tasks, i.e., object recognition (Office-Home,ImageCLEF-DA, andOffice) and synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation (GTA5CityscapesandSynthiaCityscapes).", "pdf": "/pdf/0e27cc0df2d888e9f090ddc667cf113f57a67199.pdf", "keywords": "['Domain Adaptation', 'Transfer Learning', 'Adversarial Learning']", "id": "Byg79h4tvB"}, {"number": "2480", "title": "Gradient-based training of Gaussian Mixture Models in High-Dimensional Spaces", "authors": "['Alexander Gepperth', 'Benedikt Pf\u00fclb']", "abstract": "We present an approach for efficiently training Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) on large amounts of high-dimensional data (e.g., images).

To help a convolutional neural network make predictions relying less on textural information, we propose defective convolutional layers which contain defective neurons whose activations are set to be a constant function. As the defective neurons contain no information and are far different from the standard neurons in its spatial neighborhood, the textural features cannot be accurately extracted and the model has to seek for other features for classification, such as the shape.

In this study, a new model called Sparse Deep Predictive Coding (SDPC) is introduced to assess the impact of this inter-layer feedback connection. In particular, the SDPC is compared with a Hierarchical Lasso (Hi-La) network made out of a sequence of Lasso layers. A 2-layered SDPC and a Hi-La networks are trained on 3 different databases and with different sparsity parameters on each layer.

As most physical interactions are inherently nonlinear, we consider the problem of inferring the existence of pairwise Granger causality between nonlinearly interacting stochastic processes from their time series measurements. Our proposed approach relies on modeling the embedded nonlinearities in the measurements using a component-wise time series prediction model based on Statistical Recurrent Units (SRUs). We make a case that the network topology of Granger causal relations is directly inferrable from a structured sparse estimate of the internal parameters of the SRU networks trained to predict the processes time series measurements. We propose a variant of SRU, called economy-SRU, which, by design has considerably fewer trainable parameters, and therefore less prone to overfitting. The economy-SRU computes a low-dimensional sketch of its high-dimensional hidden state in the form of random projections to generate the feedback for its recurrent processing. Additionally, the internal weight parameters of the economy-SRU are strategically regularized in a group-wise manner to facilitate the proposed network in extracting meaningful predictive features that are highly time-localized to mimic real-world causal events. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed economy-SRU based time series prediction model outperforms the MLP, LSTM and attention-gated CNN-based time series models considered previously for inferring Granger causality.

Typical ZSL models assign the class corresponding to the most relevant attribute as the predicted label of the test image based on the learned relation between the attribute and the image. However, this relation-based approach presents a difficulty: many of the test images are predicted as biased to the seen domain, i.e., the \\emph{domain bias problem}. Recently, many methods have addressed this difficulty using a synthesis-based approach that, however, requires generation of large amounts of high-quality unseen images after training and the additional training of classifier given them.  Therefore, for this study, we aim at alleviating this difficulty in the manner of the relation-based approach. First, we consider the requirements for good performance in a ZSL setting and introduce a new model based on a variational autoencoder that learns to embed attributes and images into the shared representation space which satisfies those requirements. Next, we assume that the domain bias problem in GZSL derives from a situation in which embedding of the unseen domain overlaps that of the seen one. We introduce a discriminator that distinguishes domains in a shared space and learns jointly with the above embedding model to prevent this situation.  After training, we can obtain prior knowledge from the discriminator of which domain is more likely to be embedded anywhere in the shared space. We propose combination of this knowledge and the relation-based classification on the embedded shared space as a mixture model to compensate class prediction.

We hypothesize that although boundary detection is simple at some pixels that are rooted in identifiable high-frequency locations, other pixels pose a higher level of difficulties, for instance, region pixels with an appearance similar to the boundaries; or boundary pixels with insignificant edge strengths. Therefore, the training process needs to account for different levels of learning complexity in different regions to overcome false alarms.

Many works have shown that an SNN for inference can be formed by copying the weights from a trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and setting the firing threshold for each layer as the maximum input received in that layer. These type of converted SNNs require a large number of time steps to achieve competitive accuracy which diminishes the energy savings. The number of time steps can be reduced by training SNNs with spike-based backpropagation from scratch, but that is computationally expensive and slow. To address these challenges, we present a computationally-efficient training technique for deep SNNs. We propose a hybrid training methodology: 1) take a converted SNN and use its weights and thresholds as an initialization step for spike-based backpropagation, and 2) perform incremental spike-timing dependent backpropagation (STDB) on this carefully initialized network to obtain an SNN that converges within few epochs and requires fewer time steps for input processing. STDB is performed with a novel surrogate gradient function defined using neuron's spike time. The weight update is proportional to the difference in spike timing between the current time step and the most recent time step the neuron generated an output spike. The SNNs trained with our hybrid conversion-and-STDB training perform at $10{\\times}{-}25{\\times}$ fewer number of time steps and achieve similar accuracy compared to purely converted SNNs.

This restriction does not apply to anaphoric annotation, where coders relate markables to coreference chains whose number cannot be predefined. This gap was recently covered with the introduction of a mention pair model of anaphoric annotation (MPA). In this work we extend MPA to alleviate the effects of sparsity inherent in some crowdsourcing environments. Specifically, we use a nonparametric partially pooled structure (based on a stick breaking process), fitting jointly with the ability of the annotators hierarchical community profiles. The individual estimates can thus be improved using information about the community when the data is scarce. We show, using a recently published large-scale crowdsourced anaphora dataset, that the proposed model performs better than its unpooled counterpart in conditions of sparsity, and on par when enough observations are available. The model is thus more resilient to different crowdsourcing setups, and, further provides insights into the community of workers.

We tackle this problem by focusing on Boolean classifiers expressible as formulas in the logic FOC2, a well-studied fragment of first order logic. FOC2 is tightly related to the WL test, and hence to GNNs. We start by studying a popular class of GNNs, which we call AC-GNNs, in which the features of each node in the graph are updated, in successive layers, only in terms of the features of its neighbors.  We show that this class of GNNs is too weak to capture all FOC2 classifiers, and provide a syntactic characterization of  the largest subclass of FOC2 classifiers that can be captured by AC-GNNs. This subclass coincides with a logic heavily used by the knowledge representation community. We then look at what needs to be added to AC-GNNs for capturing all FOC2 classifiers. We show that it suffices to add readout functions, which allow to update the features of a node not only in terms of its neighbors, but also in terms of a global attribute vector. We call GNNs of this kind ACR-GNNs.

Most strategies in imitation learning, however, rely on per-step supervision either from expert demonstrations, referred to as behavioral cloning or from interactive expert policy queries such as DAgger. These strategies differ on the state distribution at which the expert actions are collected -- the former using the state distribution of the expert, the latter using the state distribution of the policy being trained. However, the learning signal in both cases arises from the expert actions. On the other end of the spectrum, approaches rooted in Policy Iteration, such as Dual Policy Iteration do not choose next step actions based on an expert, but instead use planning or search over the policy to choose an action distribution to train towards. However, this can be computationally expensive, and can also end up training the policy on a state distribution that is far from the current policy's induced distribution. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that finds a middle ground by using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to perform local trajectory improvement over rollouts from the policy. We provide theoretical justification for both the proposed local trajectory search algorithm and for our use of MCTS as a local policy improvement operator.

Objective mismatch arises when one objective is optimized in the hope that a second, often uncorrelated, metric will also be optimized. In the context of MBRL, we characterize the objective mismatch between training the forward dynamics model w.r.t. the likelihood of the one-step ahead prediction, and the overall goal of improving performance on a downstream control task. For example, this issue can emerge with the realization that dynamics models effective for a specific task do not necessarily need to be globally accurate, and vice versa globally accurate models might not be sufficiently accurate locally to obtain good control performance on a specific task. In our experiments, we study this objective mismatch issue and demonstrate that the likelihood of the one-step ahead prediction is not always correlated with downstream control performance. This observation highlights a critical flaw in the current MBRL framework which will require further research to be fully understood and addressed.

They are, however, sensitive to the strategy the step size is adapted during integration, which has to be chosen by the experimenter. In this paper, we show how the design of a step size controller can be cast as a learning problem, allowing deep networks to learn to exploit structure in the initial value problem at hand in an automatic way. The key ingredients for the resulting Meta-Learning Runge-Kutta (MLRK) are the development of a good performance measure and the identification of suitable input features.

However, by studying the characteristics of the local error function we show that including the partial derivatives of the initial value problem is favorable. Our experiments demonstrate considerable benefits over traditional approaches. In particular, MLRK is able to mitigate sudden spikes in the local error function by a faster adaptation of the step size. More importantly, the additional information in the form of partial derivatives and function values leads to a substantial improvement in performance.

We first investigate the influence of NR period on regularization using weight decay and weight random noise insertion. Throughout various experiments, we show that stronger weight regularization demands longer NR period (regardless of batch size) to best utilize regularization effects. From our empirical evidence, we argue that weight regularization for every mini-batch allows small weight updates only and limited regularization effects such that there is a need to search for right NR period and weight regularization strength to enhance model accuracy. Consequently, NR period becomes especially crucial for model compression where large weight updates are necessary to increase compression ratio. Using various models, we show that simple weight updates to comply with compression formats along with long NR period is enough to achieve high compression ratio and model accuracy.", "pdf": "/pdf/3c6282f7e9737d0996fe3241a3c7031ea0850dfe.pdf", "keywords": "['Model compression', 'Weight Regularization', 'Batch Size', 'Gradient Descent']", "id": "BJlaG0VFDH"}, {"number": "2377", "title": "Plan2Vec: Unsupervised Representation Learning by Latent Plans", "authors": "['Ge Yang', 'Amy Zhang', 'Ari Morcos', 'Joelle Pineau', 'Pieter Abbeel', 'Roberto Calandra']", "abstract": "Creating a useful representation of the world takes more than just rote memorization of individual data samples. This is because fundamentally, we use our internal representation to plan, to solve problems, and to navigate the world. For a representation to be amenable to planning, it is critical for it to embody some notion of optimality. A representation learning objective that explicitly considers some form of planning should generate representations which are more computationally valuable than those that memorize samples. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{Plan2Vec}, an unsupervised representation learning objective inspired by value-based reinforcement learning methods. By abstracting away low-level control with a learned local metric, we show that it is possible to learn plannable representations that inform long-range structures, entirely passively from high-dimensional sequential datasets without supervision. A latent space is learned by playing an ``Imagined Planning Game' on the graph formed by the data points, using a local metric function trained contrastively from context. We show that the global metric on this learned embedding can be used to plan with O(1) complexity by linear interpolation. This exponential speed-up is critical for planning with a learned representation on any problem containing non-trivial global topology. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Plan2Vec on simulated toy tasks from both proprioceptive and image states, as well as two real-world image datasets, showing that Plan2Vec can effectively plan using learned representations.

Recent network quantization techniques quantize each weight kernel in a convolutional layer independently for higher inference accuracy, since the weight kernels in a layer exhibit different variances and hence have different amounts of redundancy. The quantization bitwidth or bit number (QBN) directly decides the inference accuracy, latency, energy and hardware overhead. To effectively reduce the redundancy and accelerate CNN inferences, various weight kernels should be quantized with different QBNs. However, prior works use only one QBN to quantize each convolutional layer or the entire CNN, because the design space of searching a QBN for each weight kernel is too large. The hand-crafted heuristic of the kernel-wise QBN search is so sophisticated that domain experts can obtain only sub-optimal results. It is difficult for even deep reinforcement learning (DRL) DDPG-based agents to find a kernel-wise QBN configuration that can achieve reasonable inference accuracy. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical-DRL-based kernel-wise network quantization technique, AutoQ, to automatically search a QBN for each weight kernel, and choose another QBN for each activation layer. Compared to the models quantized by the state-of-the-art DRL-based schemes, on average, the same models quantized by AutoQ reduce the inference latency by 54.06%, and decrease the inference energy consumption by 50.69%, while achieving the same inference accuracy.", "pdf": "/pdf/161683e53131806d4a14c406230d1c65f415c1f9.pdf", "keywords": "['AutoML', 'Kernel-Wise Neural Networks Quantization', 'Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning']", "id": "rygfnn4twS"}, {"number": "1204", "title": "Prediction, Consistency, Curvature: Representation Learning for Locally-Linear Control", "authors": "['Nir Levine', 'Yinlam Chow', 'Rui Shu', 'Ang Li', 'Mohammad Ghavamzadeh', 'Hung Bui']", "abstract": "Many real-world sequential decision-making problems can be formulated as optimal control with high-dimensional observations and unknown dynamics. A promising approach is to embed the high-dimensional observations into a lower-dimensional latent representation space, estimate the latent dynamics model, then utilize this model for control in the latent space. An important open question is how to learn a representation that is amenable to existing control algorithms? In this paper, we focus on learning representations for locally-linear control algorithms, such as iterative LQR (iLQR). By formulating and analyzing the representation learning problem from an optimal control perspective, we establish three underlying principles that the learned representation should comprise: 1) accurate prediction in the observation space, 2) consistency between latent and observation space dynamics, and 3) low curvature in the latent space transitions. These principles naturally correspond to a loss function that consists of three terms: prediction, consistency, and curvature (PCC). Crucially, to make PCC tractable, we derive an amortized variational bound for the PCC loss function. Extensive experiments on benchmark domains demonstrate that the new variational-PCC learning algorithm benefits from significantly more stable and reproducible training, and leads to superior control performance.  Further ablation studies give support to the importance of all three PCC components for learning a good latent space for control.", "pdf": "/pdf/45fa6ffcf44b62ef51bf27ff0cd00e506b9d116d.pdf", "keywords": "['Embed-to-Control', 'Representation Learning', 'Stochastic Optimal Control', 'VAE', 'iLQR']", "id": "BJxG_0EtDS"}, {"number": "960", "title": "Structured consistency loss for semi-supervised semantic segmentation", "authors": "['JongMok Kim', 'Joo Young Jang', 'Hyunwoo Park']", "abstract": "The consistency loss has played a key role in solving problems in recent studies on semi-supervised learning.

We propose a structured consistency loss to address this limitation of extant studies. Structured consistency loss promotes consistency in inter-pixel similarity between teacher and student networks. Specifically, collaboration with CutMix optimizes the efficient performance of semi-supervised semantic segmentation with structured consistency loss by reducing computational burden dramatically.

In this paper, we present an innovative framework for lossy image compression which is able to circumvent the quantization step by relying on a non-deterministic compression codec.

Such biased models fail to generalise when the bias shifts to a different class. The cross-bias generalisation problem has been addressed by de-biasing training data through augmentation or re-sampling, which are often prohibitive due to the data collection cost (e.g., collecting images of snowmobile on a desert) and the difficulty of quantifying or expressing biases in the first place.

Choices including Wasserstein distance and various $f$-divergences have already been explored in the adversarial networks literature, while more recently the latter class has been investigated for imitation learning. Unfortunately, we find that in practice this existing imitation-learning framework for using $f$-divergences suffers from numerical instabilities stemming from the combination of function approximation and policy-gradient reinforcement learning.

Empirically, we demonstrate that our design choices for coupling imitation learning and $f$-divergences are critical to recovering successful imitation policies. Moreover, we find that with the appropriate choice of $f$-divergence, we can obtain imitation-from-observation algorithms that outperform baseline approaches and more closely match expert performance in continous-control tasks with low-dimensional observation spaces.

Several approaches deal with this problem, largely by guiding the model with generated output history. To make training stable, these approaches often require a heuristic schedule or an auxiliary classifier. This paper introduces attention forcing, which guides the model with generated output history and reference attention. This approach can train the model to recover from its mistakes, in a stable fashion, without the need for a schedule or a classifier. In addition, it allows the model to generate output sequences aligned with the references, which can be important for cascaded systems like many speech synthesis systems.

To overcome this issue, recent works on deformation modeling seek to spatially reconfigure the data towards a common arrangement such that semantic recognition suffers less from deformation. This is typically done by augmenting static operators with learned free-form sampling grids in the image space, dynamically tuned to the data and task for adapting the receptive field. Yet adapting the receptive field does not quite reach the actual goal -- what really matters to the network is the *effective* receptive field (ERF), which reflects how much each pixel contributes. It is thus natural to design other approaches to adapt the ERF directly during runtime. In this work, we instantiate one possible solution as Deformable Kernels (DKs), a family of novel and generic convolutional operators for handling object deformations by directly adapting the ERF while leaving the receptive field untouched. At the heart of our method is the ability to resample the original kernel space towards recovering the deformation of objects. This approach is justified with theoretical insights that the ERF is strictly determined by data sampling locations and kernel values. We implement DKs as generic drop-in replacements of rigid kernels and conduct a series of empirical studies whose results conform with our theories. Over several tasks and standard base models, our approach compares favorably against prior works that adapt during runtime.

To solve this problem, we propose a hybrid weight representation (HWR) method which produces a network consisting of two types of weights, i.e., ternary weights (TW) and sparse-large weights (SLW). The TW is similar to the TTQs and requires three states to be stored in memory with 2 bits.

By encoding SLW, the networks can preserve their model size with improving their accuracy.

It allows the users to act in an informative manner to improve the safety of such systems, applied to the real-world sensitive applications. Predictive uncertainties can originate from the uncertainty in model parameters, data uncertainty or due to distributional mismatch between training and test examples. While recently, significant progress has been made to improve the predictive uncertainty estimation of deep learning models, most of these approaches either conflate the distributional uncertainty with model uncertainty or data uncertainty. In contrast, the Dirichlet Prior Network (DPN)  can model distributional uncertainty distinctly by parameterizing a prior Dirichlet over the predictive categorical distributions. However, their complex loss function by explicitly incorporating KL divergence between Dirichlet distributions often makes the error surface \nill-suited to optimize for challenging datasets with multiple classes. In this paper, we present an improved DPN framework by proposing a novel loss function using the standard cross-entropy loss along with a regularization term to control the sharpness of the output Dirichlet distributions from the network. Our proposed loss function aims to improve the training efficiency of the DPN framework for challenging classification tasks with large number of classes. In our experiments using synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate that our DPN models can distinguish the distributional uncertainty from other uncertainty types.

Besides achieving state-of-the-art performance on standard CL benchmarks, additional experiments on long task sequences reveal that task-conditioned hypernetworks display a very large capacity to retain previous memories. Notably, such long memory lifetimes are achieved in a compressive regime, when the number of trainable hypernetwork weights is comparable or smaller than target network size. We provide insight into the structure of low-dimensional task embedding spaces (the input space of the hypernetwork) and show that task-conditioned hypernetworks demonstrate transfer learning.

Despite the popularity of these common beliefs, experiments suggest that they are insufficient in explaining the general effectiveness of lrDecay in training modern neural networks that are deep, wide, and nonconvex. We provide another novel explanation: an initially large learning rate suppresses the network from memorizing noisy data while decaying the learning rate improves the learning of complex patterns. The proposed explanation is validated on a carefully-constructed dataset with tractable pattern complexity. And its implication, that additional patterns learned in later stages of lrDecay are more complex and thus less transferable, is justified in real-world datasets.

To address this issue, we propose to add random noise to the input data and prove a generalization bound for training with random noise, which is an extension of the former one. Compared with existing results, our generalization bounds have no explicit dependency on the size of networks.

Existing non-learned planning solutions from the Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) literature rely on the existence of logical descriptions for the effects and preconditions for actions. This constraint allows TAMP methods to efficiently reduce the tree search problem but limits their ability to generalize to unseen and complex physical environments.

However, DRL methods have had trouble dealing with the very sparse reward landscapes inherent to long-range multi-step planning situations. Here, we propose the Curious Sample Planner (CSP), which fuses elements of TAMP and DRL by using a curiosity-guided sampling strategy to learn to efficiently explore the tree of action effects. We show that CSP can efficiently discover interesting and complex temporally-extended plans for solving a wide range of physically realistic 3D tasks. In contrast, standard DRL and random sampling methods often fail to solve these tasks at all or do so only with a huge and highly variable number of training samples.

This energy can be augmented with regularization terms that model priors on what constitutes the user-defined optimal projection. By iteratively updating the input of the autoencoder, we bypass the loss of high-frequency information caused by the autoencoder bottleneck. This allows to produce images of higher quality than classic reconstructions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on various anomaly localization datasets.

In this paper, we propose a heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimisation scheme which both represents and optimises aleatoric noise in the suggestions. We consider cases such as drug discovery where we would like to minimise or be robust to aleatoric uncertainty but also applications such as materials discovery where it may be beneficial to maximise or be antifragile to aleatoric uncertainty. Our scheme features a heteroscedastic Gaussian Process (GP) as the surrogate model in conjunction with two acquisition heuristics. First, we extend the augmented expected improvement (AEI) heuristic to the heteroscedastic setting and second, we introduce a new acquisition function, aleatoric-penalised expected improvement (ANPEI) based on a simple scalarisation of the performance and noise objective.

For several flatness measures, this correlation has been empirically validated. However, it has recently been shown that existing measures of flatness cannot theoretically be related to generalization: if a network uses ReLU activations, the network function can be reparameterized without changing its output in such a way that flatness is changed almost arbitrarily. This paper proposes a natural modification of existing flatness measures that results in invariance to reparameterization. The proposed measures imply a robustness of the network to changes in the input and the hidden layers. Connecting this feature robustness to generalization leads to a generalized definition of the representativeness of data.

In particular, we consider continual learning in classification tasks. For each classification task, our method learns a metric space containing a set of prototypes where embedding of the samples from the same class cluster around prototypes and class-representative prototypes are separated apart. To alleviate catastrophic forgetting, our method preserves the embedding function from the samples to the previous metric space, through our proposed prototype recalls from previous tasks. Specifically, the recalling process is implemented by replaying a small number of samples from previous tasks and correspondingly matching their embedding to their nearest class-representative prototypes. Compared with recent continual learning methods, our contributions are fourfold: first, our method achieves the best memory retention capability while adapting quickly to new tasks. Second, our method uses metric learning for classification and does not require adding in new neurons given new object classes. Third, our method is more memory efficient since only class-representative prototypes need to be recalled. Fourth, our method suggests a promising solution for few-shot continual learning.

Specifically, it is known that He initialization in deep ReLU networks asymptotically preserves variance of activations in the forward pass and variance of gradients in the backward pass for infinitely wide networks, thus preserving the flow of information in both directions. Our paper goes beyond these results and shows novel properties that hold under He initialization: i) the norm of hidden activation of each layer is equal to the norm of the input, and, ii) the norm of weight gradient of each layer is equal to the product of norm of the input vector and the error at output layer. These results are derived using the PAC analysis framework, and hold true for finitely sized datasets such that the width of the ReLU network only needs to be larger than a certain finite lower bound. As we show, this lower bound depends on the depth of the network and the number of samples, and by the virtue of being a lower bound, over-parameterized ReLU networks are endowed with these desirable properties. For the aforementioned hidden activation norm property under He initialization, we further extend our theory and show that this property holds for a finite width network even when the number of data samples is infinite.

The key idea is to let agents imagine together; make them take turns to host virtual episodes within which all agents participate and interact with their own biased representations. Since agents' biases vary, the collective policy developed while sequentially visiting the internal simulations complement one another's shortcomings. In our experiment, the collective policies consistently achieve significantly higher returns than the best individually trained policies.", "pdf": "/pdf/02cfd4e2243800144651460e7dc8cc377568a513.pdf", "keywords": "['collective policy', 'biased representation', 'model-based RL', 'simulation', 'imagination', 'virtual environment']", "id": "Skg2pkHFwS"}, {"number": "1555", "title": "Evaluating Semantic Representations of Source Code", "authors": "['Yaza Wainakh', 'Moiz Rauf', 'Michael Pradel']", "abstract": "Learned representations of source code enable various software developer tools, e.g., to detect bugs or to predict program properties. At the core of code representations often are word embeddings of identifier names in source code, because identifiers account for the majority of source code vocabulary and convey important semantic information. Unfortunately, there currently is no generally accepted way of evaluating the quality of word embeddings of identifiers, and current evaluations are biased toward specific downstream tasks. This paper presents IdBench, the first benchmark for evaluating to what extent word embeddings of identifiers represent semantic relatedness and similarity. The benchmark is based on thousands of ratings gathered by surveying 500 software developers. We use IdBench to evaluate state-of-the-art embedding techniques proposed for natural language, an embedding technique specifically designed for source code, and lexical string distance functions, as these are often used in current developer tools. Our results show that the effectiveness of embeddings varies significantly across different embedding techniques and that the best available embeddings successfully represent semantic relatedness. On the downside, no existing embedding provides a satisfactory representation of semantic similarities, e.g., because embeddings consider identifiers with opposing meanings as similar, which may lead to fatal mistakes in downstream developer tools. IdBench provides a gold standard to guide the development of novel embeddings that address the current limitations.\n", "pdf": "/pdf/c62c376c1ea19bc9ccceecf4e38814d9f3baebe7.pdf", "keywords": "['embeddings', 'representation', 'source code', 'identifiers']", "id": "SklibJBFDB"}, {"number": "1645", "title": "LIA: Latently Invertible Autoencoder with Adversarial Learning", "authors": "['Jiapeng Zhu', 'Deli Zhao', 'Bolei Zhou', 'Bo Zhang']", "abstract": "Deep generative models such as Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) play an increasingly important role in machine learning and computer vision.

First, we argue that stochastic gradient descent exhibits two regimes with different behaviours; a noise dominated regime which typically arises for small or moderate batch sizes, and a curvature dominated regime which typically arises when the batch size is large. In the noise dominated regime, the optimal learning rate increases as the batch size rises, and the training loss and test accuracy are independent of batch size under a constant epoch budget. In the curvature dominated regime, the optimal learning rate is independent of batch size, and the training loss and test accuracy degrade as the batch size rises. We support these claims with experiments on a range of architectures including ResNets, LSTMs and autoencoders. We always perform a grid search over learning rates at all batch sizes. Second, we demonstrate that small or moderately large batch sizes continue to outperform very large batches on the test set, even when both models are trained for the same number of steps and reach similar training losses. Furthermore, when training Wide-ResNets on CIFAR-10 with a constant batch size of 64, the optimal learning rate to maximize the test accuracy only decays by a factor of 2 when the epoch budget is increased by a factor of 128, while the optimal learning rate to minimize the training loss decays by a factor of 16.

To train a Transformer model, a carefully designed learning rate warm-up stage is usually needed: the learning rate has to be set to an extremely small value at the beginning of the optimization and then gradually increases in some given number of iterations. Such a stage is shown to be crucial to the final performance and brings more hyper-parameter tunings. In this paper, we study why the learning rate warm-up stage is important in training the Transformer and theoretically show that the location of layer normalization matters. It can be proved that at the beginning of the optimization, for the original Transformer, which places the layer normalization between the residual blocks, the expected gradients of the parameters near the output layer are large. Then using a large learning rate on those gradients makes the training unstable. The warm-up stage is practically helpful to avoid this problem. Such an analysis motivates us to investigate a slightly modified Transformer architecture which locates the layer normalization inside the residual blocks. We show that the gradients in this Transformer architecture are well-behaved at initialization. Given these findings,  we are the first to show that this Transformer variant is easier and faster to train.

As a remedy, we     propose constrained adversarial networks (CANs), which embed the constraints into the model during training by penalizing the generator whenever it outputs invalid structures.

By maximizing the likelihood of good actions provided by an expert demonstrator, supervised imitation learning can produce effective policies without the algorithmic complexities and optimization challenges of reinforcement learning, at the cost of requiring an expert demonstrator -- typically a person -- to provide the demonstrations. In this paper, we ask: can we use imitation learning to train effective policies without any expert demonstrations? The key observation that makes this possible is that, in the multi-task setting, trajectories that are generated by a suboptimal policy can still serve as optimal examples for other tasks. In particular, in the setting where the tasks correspond to different goals, every trajectory is a successful demonstration for the state that it actually reaches. Informed by this observation, we propose a very simple algorithm for learning behaviors without any demonstrations, user-provided reward functions, or complex reinforcement learning methods. Our method simply maximizes the likelihood of actions the agent actually took in its own previous rollouts, conditioned on the goal being the state that it actually reached. Although related variants of this approach have been proposed previously in imitation learning settings with example demonstrations, we present the first instance of this approach as a method for learning goal-reaching policies entirely from scratch.

The main difficulties of expensive coordination are that i) the leader has to consider the long-term effect and predict the followers' behaviors when assigning bonuses and ii) the complex interactions between followers make the training process hard to converge, especially when the leader's policy changes with time. In this work, we address this problem through an event-based deep RL approach. Our main contributions are threefold.

So far, the relationship between these two notions of adversarial examples has not been studied, we close this gap.\n\nWe demonstrate that solely achieving perturbation-based robustness is insufficient for complete adversarial robustness.

A core component of our work is the handling of view-dependent effects. Specifically, we directly train an object-specific deep neural network to synthesize the view-dependent appearance of an object.\nAs input data we are using an RGB video of the object. This video is used to reconstruct a proxy geometry of the object via multi-view stereo. Based on this 3D proxy, the appearance of a captured view can be warped into a new target view as in classical image-based rendering. This warping assumes diffuse surfaces, in case of view-dependent effects, such as specular highlights, it leads to artifacts. To this end, we propose EffectsNet, a deep neural network that predicts view-dependent effects. Based on these estimations, we are able to convert observed images to diffuse images. These diffuse images can be projected into other views. In the target view, our pipeline reinserts the new view-dependent effects. To composite multiple reprojected images to a final output, we learn a composition network that outputs photo-realistic results.

VP algorithms essentially combine data-driven perception and planning, and are important for robotic manipulation and navigation domains, among others. A recent and promising approach to VP is the semi-parametric topological memory (SPTM) method, where image samples are treated as nodes in a graph, and the connectivity in the graph is learned using deep image classification. Thus, the learned graph represents the topological connectivity of the data, and planning can be performed using conventional graph search methods. However, training SPTM necessitates a suitable loss function for the connectivity classifier, which requires non-trivial manual tuning. More importantly, SPTM is constricted in its ability to generalize to changes in the domain, as its graph is constructed from direct observations and thus requires collecting new samples for planning. In this paper, we propose Hallucinative Topological Memory (HTM), which overcomes these shortcomings. In HTM, instead of training a discriminative classifier we train an energy function using contrastive predictive coding. In addition, we learn a conditional VAE model that generates samples given a context image of the domain, and use these hallucinated samples for building the connectivity graph, allowing for zero-shot generalization to domain changes. In simulated domains, HTM outperforms conventional SPTM and visual foresight methods in terms of both plan quality and success in long-horizon planning.

In both of these cases, we are building a sequence of models that incorporate an increasing amount of data. We would like each of these models in the sequence to be performant and take advantage of all the data that are available to that point. Conventional intuition suggests that when solving a sequence of related optimization problems of this form, it should be possible to initialize using the solution of the previous iterate---to 'warm start'' the optimization rather than initialize from scratch---and see reductions in wall-clock time. However, in practice this warm-starting seems to yield poorer generalization performance than models that have fresh random initializations, even though the final training losses are similar. While it appears that some hyperparameter settings allow a practitioner to close this generalization gap, they seem to only do so in regimes that damage the wall-clock gains of the warm start. Nevertheless, it is highly desirable to be able to warm-start neural network training, as it would dramatically reduce the resource usage associated with the construction of performant deep learning systems.

In contrast, this paper investigates the problem of devising optimal attacks, depending on a well-defined attacker's objective, e.g., to minimize the main agent average reward. When the policy and the system dynamics, as well as rewards, are known to the attacker, a scenario referred to as a white-box attack, designing optimal attacks amounts to solving a Markov Decision Process. For what we call black-box attacks, where neither the policy nor the system is known, optimal attacks can be trained using Reinforcement Learning techniques. Through  numerical experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of our attacks compared to existing attacks (usually based on Gradient methods). We further quantify the potential impact of attacks and establish its connection to the smoothness of the policy under attack. Smooth policies are naturally less prone to attacks (this explains why Lipschitz policies, with respect to the state, are more resilient). Finally, we show that from the main agent perspective, the system uncertainties and the attacker can be modelled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process.

Further, this smoothness positively correlates with the gradient norm, and contrary to standard assumptions in the literature, it can grow with the norm of the gradient. These empirical observations limit the applicability of existing theoretical analyses of algorithms that rely on a fixed bound on smoothness. These observations motivate us to introduce a novel relaxation of gradient smoothness that is weaker than the commonly used Lipschitz smoothness assumption.

Less well studied, though, is the problem of treatment response estimation when the treatments are accompanied by a continuous dosage parameter. In this paper, we tackle this lesser studied problem by building on a modification of the generative adversarial networks (GANs) framework that has already demonstrated effectiveness in the former problem. Our model, DRGAN, is flexible, capable of handling multiple treatments each accompanied by a dosage parameter. The key idea is to use a significantly modified GAN model to generate entire dose-response curves for each sample in the training data which will then allow us to use standard supervised methods to learn an inference model capable of estimating these curves for a new sample. Our model consists of 3 blocks: (1) a generator, (2) a discriminator, (3) an inference block. In order to address the challenge presented by the introduction of dosages, we propose novel architectures for both our generator and discriminator. We model the generator as a multi-task deep neural network. In order to address the increased complexity of the treatment space (because of the addition of dosages), we develop a hierarchical discriminator consisting of several networks: (a) a treatment discriminator, (b) a dosage discriminator for each treatment.

While deep ensembles were theoretically motivated by the bootstrap, non-bootstrap ensembles trained with just random initialization also perform well in practice, which suggests that there could be other explanations for why deep ensembles work well. Bayesian neural networks, which learn distributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically well-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep ensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible explanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable approximate Bayesian methods tend to focus on a single mode, whereas deep ensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space. We investigate this hypothesis by building on recent work on understanding the loss landscape of neural networks and adding our own exploration to measure the similarity of functions in the space of predictions. Our results show that random initializations explore entirely different modes, while functions along an optimization trajectory or sampled from the subspace thereof cluster within a single mode predictions-wise, while often deviating significantly in the weight space. We demonstrate that while low-loss connectors between modes exist, they are not connected in the space of predictions.

In these scalable RL architectures, as one increases sample throughput (i.e. increasing parallelization in IMPALA (Espeholt et al., 2018)), sample efficiency drops significantly.

This provides a strong inductive bias towards semantically meaningful relations, yielding more generalizable representations than classical sequence-based models.

One of the most important techniques used in previous work involves an ensemble of teacher models, which return information to a student based on a noisy voting procedure.  In this work, we propose a novel voting mechanism, which we call an Immutable Noisy ArgMax, that, under certain conditions, can bear very large random noising from the teacher without affecting the useful information transferred to the student. Our mechanisms improve over the state-of-the-art methods on all measures, and scale to larger tasks with both higher utility and stronger privacy ($\\epsilon \\approx 0$).", "pdf": "/pdf/d315f5b524580c06a1994893543c610fcffce83f.pdf", "keywords": "[]", "id": "Syl38yrFwr"}, {"number": "1527", "title": "NAS-Bench-201: Extending the Scope of Reproducible Neural Architecture Search", "authors": "['Xuanyi Dong', 'Yi Yang']", "abstract": "Neural architecture search (NAS) has achieved breakthrough success in a great number of applications in the past few years.\nIt could be time to take a step back and analyze the good and bad aspects in the field of NAS.

This raises a comparability problem when comparing the performance of various NAS algorithms. NAS-Bench-101 has shown success to alleviate this problem. In this work, we propose an extension to NAS-Bench-101: NAS-Bench-201 with a different search space, results on multiple datasets, and more diagnostic information. NAS-Bench-201 has a fixed search space and provides a unified benchmark for almost any up-to-date NAS algorithms. The design of our search space is inspired by the one used in the most popular cell-based searching algorithms, where a cell is represented as a directed acyclic graph. Each edge here is associated with an operation selected from a predefined operation set. For it to be applicable for all NAS algorithms, the search space defined in NAS-Bench-201 includes all possible architectures generated by 4 nodes and 5 associated operation options, which results in 15,625 neural cell candidates in total. The training log using the same setup and the performance for each architecture candidate are provided for three datasets. This allows researchers to avoid unnecessary repetitive training for selected architecture and focus solely on the search algorithm itself. The training time saved for every architecture also largely improves the efficiency of most NAS algorithms and presents a more computational cost friendly NAS community for a broader range of researchers. We provide additional diagnostic information such as fine-grained loss and accuracy, which can give inspirations to new designs of NAS algorithms.

This is primarily due to the heavy cognitive loads required for human agents to reason and report this high dimensional information. Consider the example where we are interested in building an image classifier via first collecting a certain category of  high-dimensional image data. While classical elicitation results apply to eliciting a complex and generative (and continuous) distribution $p(x)$ for this image data, we are interested in eliciting samples $x_i \\sim p(x)$ from agents.

The challenge to do so is to design an incentive-compatible score function to score each reported sample to induce truthful reports, instead of an arbitrary or even adversarial one. We show that with accurate estimation of a certain $f$-divergence function we are able to achieve approximate incentive compatibility in eliciting truthful samples. We then present an efficient estimator with theoretical guarantee via studying the variational forms of $f$-divergence function.

These properties make it a natural fit to guide the training of interactive agents as it could ease recurrent challenges in Reinforcement Learning such as sample complexity, generalization, or multi-tasking. Yet, it remains an open-problem to relate language and RL in even simple instruction following scenarios. Current methods rely on expert demonstrations, auxiliary losses, or inductive biases in neural architectures. In this paper, we propose an orthogonal approach called Textual Hindsight Experience Replay (THER) that extends the Hindsight Experience Replay approach to the language setting. Whenever the agent does not fulfill its instruction, THER learn to output a new directive that matches the agent trajectory, and it relabels the episode with a positive reward. To do so, THER learns to map a state into an instruction by using past successful trajectories, which removes the need to have external expert interventions to relabel episodes as in vanilla HER. We observe that this simple idea also initiates a learning synergy between language acquisition and policy learning on instruction following tasks in the BabyAI environment.

The key insight of our results is based on a risk decomposition theorem, in which the expected robust risk is separated into two parts: the stability part which measures the prediction stability in the presence of perturbations, and the accuracy part which evaluates the standard classification accuracy. As the stability part does not depend on any label information, we can optimize this part using unlabeled data. We further prove that for a specific Gaussian mixture problem, adversarially robust generalization can be almost as easy as the standard generalization in supervised learning if a sufficiently large amount of unlabeled data is provided.

Typically, previous works have approached this issue either by attempting to train a neural network that directly produces updates or by attempting to learn better initialisations or scaling factors for a gradient-based update rule. Both of these approaches pose challenges. On one hand, directly producing an update forgoes a useful inductive bias and can easily lead to non-converging behaviour. On the other hand, approaches that try to control a gradient-based update rule typically resort to computing gradients through the learning process to obtain their meta-gradients, leading to methods that can not scale beyond few-shot task adaptation. In this work, we propose Warped Gradient Descent (WarpGrad), a method that intersects these approaches to mitigate their limitations. WarpGrad meta-learns an efficiently parameterised preconditioning matrix that facilitates gradient descent across the task distribution. Preconditioning arises by interleaving non-linear layers, referred to as warp-layers, between the layers of a task-learner. Warp-layers are meta-learned without backpropagating through the task training process in a manner similar to methods that learn to directly produce updates. WarpGrad is computationally efficient, easy to implement, and can scale to arbitrarily large meta-learning problems.

In many problem settings, including the reinforcement learning problems we consider in this work, we might prefer to compress only part of the input. This is typically the case when we have a standard conditioning input, such as a state observation, and a ``privileged'' input, which might correspond to the goal of a task, the output of a costly planning algorithm, or communication with another agent. In such cases, we might prefer to compress the privileged input, either to achieve better generalization (e.g., with respect to goals) or to minimize access to costly information (e.g., in the case of communication). Practical implementations of the information bottleneck based on variational inference require access to the privileged input in order to compute the bottleneck variable, so although they perform compression, this compression operation itself needs unrestricted, lossless access. In this work, we propose the variational bandwidth bottleneck, which decides for each example on the estimated value of the privileged information before seeing it, i.e., only based on the standard input, and then accordingly chooses stochastically, whether to access the privileged input or not.

While we do not find evidence in favor of the former, our results show significant support for the latter.", "pdf": "/pdf/9c9b88ad19a7dfb8d9606bf435902b7368f9ecf7.pdf", "keywords": "['Emergent Communication', 'Speaker-Listener Models']", "id": "SkgJOAEtvr"}, {"number": "1173", "title": "Improved Structural Discovery and Representation Learning of Multi-Agent Data", "authors": "['Jennifer Hobbs', 'Matthew Holbrook', 'Nathan Frank', 'Long Sha', 'Patrick Lucey']", "abstract": "Central to all machine learning algorithms is data representation.

However, it has been observed that flows trained on FashionMNIST assign higher likelihoods to OoD samples from MNIST. This counter-intuitive observation raises the concern about the robustness of flows' likelihood. In this paper, we explore the correlation between flows' likelihood and image semantics. We choose two typical flows as the target models: Glow, based on coupling transformations, and pixelCNN, based on autoregressive transformations. Our experiments reveal surprisingly weak correlation between flows' likelihoods and image semantics: the predictive likelihoods of flows can be heavily affected by trivial transformations that keep the image semantics unchanged, which we call semantic-invariant transformations~(SITs). We explore three SITs~(all small pixel-level modifications): image pixel translation, random noise perturbation, latent factors zeroing~(limited to flows using multi-scale architecture, e.g. Glow). These findings, though counter-intuitive, resonate with the fact that the predictive likelihood of a flow is the joint probability of all the image pixels.

Here, we analyze the dynamics of training deep neural networks under a generalized family of natural gradient methods that applies curvature corrections, and derive precise analytical solutions. Our analysis reveals that curvature corrected update rules preserve many features of gradient descent, such that the learning trajectory of each singular mode in natural gradient descent follows precisely the same path as gradient descent, while only accelerating the temporal dynamics along the path.

However, there exists a simple, yet easily overlooked fact that adversarial examples are only defined on correctly classified (natural) examples, but inevitably, some (natural) examples will be misclassified during training. In this paper, we investigate the distinctive influence of misclassified and correctly classified examples on the final robustness of adversarial training.

Recent results have found highly selective units and object detectors in NNs that are indicative of local codes (LCs). Here we undertake a constructionist study on feed-forward NNs and find LCs emerging in response to invariant features, and this finding is robust until the invariant feature is perturbed by 40%. Decreasing the number of input data, increasing the relative weight of the invariant features and large values of dropout all increase the number of LCs. Longer training times increase the number of LCs and the turning point of the LC-epoch curve correlates well with the point at which NNs reach 90-100% on both test and training accuracy. Pseudo-deep networks (2 hidden layers) which have many LCs lose them when common aspects of deep-NN research are applied (large training data, ReLU activations, early stopping on training accuracy and softmax), suggesting that LCs may not be found in deep-NNs. Switching to more biologically feasible constraints (sigmoidal activation functions, longer training times, dropout, activation noise) increases the number of LCs. If LCs are not found in the feed-forward classification layers of modern deep-CNNs these data suggest this could either be caused by a lack of (moderately) invariant features being passed to the fully connected layers or due to the choice of training conditions and architecture. Should the interpretability and resilience to noise of LCs be required, this work suggests how to tune a NN so they emerge.

In this work, we present a novel approach to population-based RL in continuous control that leverages properties of normalizing flows to perform attractive and repulsive operations between current members of the population and previously observed policies. Empirical results on the MuJoCo suite demonstrate a high performance gain for our algorithm compared to prior work, including Soft-Actor Critic (SAC).

Learning how to predict future events from patterns of past events becomes more difficult as we consider more types of events. Many of the patterns detected in the dataset by an ordinary LSTM will be spurious since the number of potential pairwise correlations, for example, grows quadratically with the number of events. We propose a type of factorial LSTM architecture where different blocks of LSTM cells are responsible for capturing different aspects of the world state. We use Datalog rules to specify how to derive the LSTM structure from a database of facts about the entities in the world. This is analogous to how a probabilistic relational model (Getoor & Taskar, 2007) specifies a recipe for deriving a graphical model structure from a database. In both cases, the goal is to obtain useful inductive biases by encoding informed independence assumptions into the model. We specifically consider the neural Hawkes process, which uses an LSTM to modulate the rate of instantaneous events in continuous time. In both synthetic and real-world domains, we show that we obtain better generalization by using appropriate factorial designs specified by simple Datalog programs.\n", "pdf": "/pdf/91dcbe5f60f1e52c8558cc244c58521e3828e0ef.pdf", "keywords": "['factorized LSTM', 'temporal point process', 'event streams', 'structural bias', 'Datalog']", "id": "S1ghzlHFPS"}, {"number": "2449", "title": "Continual Learning using the SHDL Framework with Skewed Replay Distributions", "authors": "['Amarjot Singh', 'Jay McClelland']", "abstract": "Human and animals continuously acquire, adapt as well as transfer knowledge throughout their lifespan. The ability to learn continuously is crucial for the effective functioning of agents interacting with the real world and processing continuous streams of information. Continuous learning has been a long-standing challenge for neural networks as the repeated acquisition of information from non-uniform data distributions generally lead to catastrophic forgetting or interference.  This work proposes a modular architecture capable of continuous acquisition of tasks while averting catastrophic forgetting.  Specifically, our contributions are: (i) Efficient Architecture: a modular architecture emulating the visual cortex that can learn meaningful representations with limited labelled examples, (ii) Knowledge Retention: retention of learned knowledge via limited replay of past experiences, (iii) Forward Transfer: efficient and relatively faster learning on new tasks, and (iv) Naturally Skewed Distributions: The learning  in the above-mentioned claims is performed on non-uniform data distributions which better represent the natural statistics of our ongoing experience.

However, especially for complex datasets, adversarial training incurs a significant loss in accuracy and is known to generalize poorly to stronger attacks, e.g., larger perturbations or other threat models. In this paper, we introduce  confidence-calibrated adversarial training (CCAT) where the key idea is to enforce that the confidence on adversarial examples decays with their distance to the attacked examples. We show that CCAT preserves better the accuracy of normal training while robustness against adversarial examples is achieved via confidence thresholding. Most importantly, in strong contrast to adversarial training, the robustness of CCAT generalizes to larger perturbations and other threat models, not encountered during training. We also discuss our extensive work to design strong adaptive attacks against CCAT and standard adversarial training which is of independent interest.

Quantifying or at least upper-bounding their uncertainties is vital for safety-critical systems. While standard neural networks do not report this information, several approaches exist to integrate uncertainty estimates into them. Assessing the quality of these uncertainty estimates is not straightforward, as no direct ground truth labels are available. Instead, implicit statistical assessments are required. For regression, we propose to evaluate uncertainty realism---a strict quality criterion---with a Mahalanobis distance-based statistical test. An empirical evaluation reveals the need for uncertainty measures that are appropriate to upper-bound heavy-tailed empirical errors. Alongside, we transfer the variational U-Net classification architecture to standard supervised image-to-image tasks.

In this work, we improve the performance of DP models by fine-tuning them through active learning on public data.

However, as we discover in this work, commonly used data sets for graph classification have repeating instances which cause the problem of isomorphism bias, i.e. artificially increasing the accuracy of the models by memorizing target information from the training set. This prevents fair competition of the algorithms and raises a question of the validity of the obtained results. We analyze 54 data sets, previously extensively used for graph-related tasks, on the existence of isomorphism bias, give a set of recommendations to machine learning practitioners to properly set up their models, and open source new data sets for the future experiments.

Variants of the Transformer have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many tasks including language modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Dai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Al-Rfou et al., 2018</xref>) and machine translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Vaswani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dehghani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Edunov et al., 2018</xref>). Unsupervised pre-trained models based on the Transformer architecture also show impressive performance in many downstream tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Radford et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Devlin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The Transformer architecture is mainly built by stacking layers, each of which consists of two sub-layers with residual connections: the self-attention sub-layer and the position-wise feed-forward network (FFN) sub-layer. For a given sentence, the self-attention sub-layer considers the semantics and dependencies of words at different positions and uses that information to capture the internal structure and representations of the sentence. The position-wise FFN sub-layer is applied to each position separately and identically to encode context at each position into higher-level representations. Although the Transformer architecture has demonstrated promising results in many tasks, its design principle is not fully understood, and thus the strength of the architecture is not fully exploited. As far as we know, there is little work studying the foundation of the Transformer or different design choices.</p><p>In this paper, we provide a novel perspective towards understanding the architecture. In particular, we are the first to show that the Transformer architecture is inherently related to the Multi-Particle Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 Dynamic System (MPDS) in physics. MPDS is a well-established research field which aims at modeling how a collection of particles move in the space using differential equations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Moulton, 2012</xref>). In MPDS, the behavior of each particle is usu- ally modeled by two factors separately. The first factor is the convection which concerns the mech- anism of each particle regardless of other particles in the system, and the second factor is the diffu- sion which models the movement of the particle resulting from other particles in the system.</p><p>Inspired by the relationship between the ODE and neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Chen et al., 2018a</xref>), we first show that the Transformer lay- ers can be naturally interpreted as a numerical ODE solver for a first-order convection-diffusion equation in MPDS. To be more specific, the self- attention sub-layer, which transforms the seman- tics at one position by attending over all other positions, corresponds to the diffusion term; The position-wise FFN sub-layer, which is applied to each position separately and identically, corresponds to the convection term. The number of stacked layers in the Transformer corresponds to the time dimension in ODE. In this way, the stack of self-attention sub-layers and position-wise FFN sub-layers with residual connections can be viewed as solving the ODE problem numerically using the Lie-Trotter splitting scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Geiser, 2009</xref>) and the Euler's method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Ascher &amp; Petzold, 1998</xref>). By this interpretation, we have a novel understanding of learning contextual representations of a sentence using the Transformer: the feature (a.k.a, embed- ding) of words in a sequence can be considered as the initial positions of a collection of particles, and the latent representations abstracted in stacked Transformer layers can be viewed as the location of particles moving in a high-dimensional space at different time points.</p><p>Such an interpretation not only provides a new perspective on the Transformer but also inspires us to design new structures by leveraging the rich literature of numerical analysis. The Lie-Trotter splitting scheme is simple but not accurate and often leads to high approximation error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Geiser, 2009</xref>). The Strang-Marchuk splitting scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Strang, 1968</xref>) is developed to reduce the approximation error by a simple modification to the Lie-Trotter splitting scheme and is theoretically more accurate. Mapped to neural network design, the Strang-Marchuk splitting scheme suggests that there should be three sub-layers: two position-wise feed-forward sub-layers with half-step residual connections and one self-attention sub-layer placed in between with a full-step residual connection. By doing so, the stacked layers will be more accurate from the ODE's perspective and will lead to better performance in deep learning. As the FFN-attention-FFN layer is "Macaron-like", we call it Macaron layer and call the network composed of Macaron layers the Macaron Net.</p><p>We conduct extensive experiments on both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. For each task, we replace Transformer layers by Macaron layers and keep the number of parameters to be the same. Experiments show that the Macaron Net can achieve higher accuracy than the Transformer on all tasks which, in a way, is consistent with the ODE theory.</p></sec><sec><title>BACKGROUND</title></sec><sec><title>RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NEURAL NETWORKS AND ODE</title><p>Recently, there are extensive studies to bridge deep neural networks with ordinary differential equations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Weinan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Haber &amp; Ruthotto, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Chen et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Zhang et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Sonoda &amp; Murata, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Thorpe &amp; van Gennip, 2018</xref>). We here present a brief introduction to such a relationship and discuss how previous works borrow powerful tools from numerical analysis to help deep neural network design.</p><p>A first-order ODE problem is usually defined as to solve the equation (i.e., calculate x(t) for any t) which satisfies the following first-order derivative and the initial condition:</p><p>Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 in which x(t) &#8712; R d for all t &#8805; t 0 . ODEs usually have physical interpretations. For example, x(t) can be considered as the location of a particle moving in the d-dimensional space and the first order time derivative can be considered as the velocity of the particle.</p><p>Usually there is no analytic solution to Eqn (1) and the problem has to be solved numerically. The simplest numerical ODE solver is the Euler's method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Ascher &amp; Petzold, 1998</xref>). The Euler's method discretizes the time derivative dx(t) dt by its first-order approximation x(t2)&#8722;x(t1) t2&#8722;t1 &#8776; f (x(t 1 ), t 1 ). By doing so, for the fixed time horizon T = t 0 + &#947;L, we can estimate x(T ) from x 0 . = x(t 0 ) by sequentially estimating x l+1 . = x(t l+1 ) using x l+1 = x l + &#947;f (x l , t l ) (2) where l = 0, &#183; &#183; &#183; , L &#8722; 1, t l = t 0 + &#947;l is the time point corresponds to x l , and &#947; = (T &#8722; t 0 )/L is the step size. As we can see, this is mathematically equivalent to the ResNet architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Chen et al., 2018a</xref>): The function &#947;f (x l , t l ) can be considered as a neural-network block, and the second argument t l in the function indicates the set of parameters in the l-th layer. The simple temporal discretization by Euler's method naturally leads to the residual connection.</p><p>Observing such a strong relationship, researchers use ODE theory to explain and improve the neural network architectures mainly designed for computer vision tasks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Lu et al. (2017)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Chen et al. (2018a)</xref> show any parametric ODE solver can be viewed as a deep residual network (probably with infinite layers), and the parameters in the ODE can be optimized through backpropagation. Recent works discover that new neural networks inspired by sophisticated numerical ODE solvers can lead to better performance. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Zhu et al. (2018)</xref> uses a high-precision Runge-Kutta method to design a neural network, and the new architecture achieves higher accuracy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Haber &amp; Ruthotto (2017)</xref> uses a leap-frog method to construct a reversible neural network. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Liao &amp; Poggio (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Chang et al. (2019)</xref> try to understand recurrent neural networks from the ODE's perspective, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Tao et al. (2018)</xref> uses non-local differential equations to model non-local neural networks.</p></sec><sec><title>TRANSFORMER</title><p>The Transformer architecture is usually developed by stacking Transformer layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Vaswani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Devlin et al., 2018</xref>). A Transformer layer operates on a sequence of vectors and outputs a new sequence of the same shape. The computation inside a layer is decomposed into two steps: the vectors first pass through a (multi-head) self-attention sub-layer and the output will be further put into a position-wise feed-forward network sub-layer. Residual connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">He et al., 2016</xref>) and layer normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Lei Ba et al., 2016</xref>) are employed for both sub-layers. The visualization of a Transformer layer is shown in Figure 2(a) and the two sub-layers are defined as below.</p></sec><sec><title>Self-attention sub-layer</title><p>The attention mechanism can be formulated as querying a dictionary with key-value pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Vaswani et al., 2017</xref>), e.g., Attention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QK T / &#8730; d model ) &#183; V, where d model is the dimensionality of the hidden representations and Q (Query), K (Key), V (Value) are specified as the hidden representations of the previous layer in the so-called self-attention sub- layers in the Transformer architecture. The multi-head variant of attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces, and is defined as</p><p>project parameter matrices, H is the number of heads, and d K and d V are the dimensionalities of Key and Value.</p></sec><sec><title>Position-wise FFN sub-layer</title><p>In addition to the self-attention sub-layer, each Transformer layer also contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This feed-forward network consists of two linear transformations with an activation function &#963; in between. Specially, given vectors h 1 , . . . , h n , a position-wise FFN sub-layer transforms each h i as FFN(h i ) = &#963;(h i W 1 + b 1 )W 2 + b 2 , where W 1 , W 2 , b 1 and b 2 are parameters.</p><p>In this paper, we take the first attempt to provide an understanding of the feature extraction process in natural language processing from the ODE's viewpoint. As discussed in Section 2.1, several Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 works interpret the standard ResNet using the ODE theory. However, we found this interpretation cannot be directly applied to the Transformer architecture. First, different from vision applications whose size of the input (e.g., an image) is usually predefined and fixed, the input (e.g., a sentence) in natural language processing is always of variable length, which makes the single-particle ODE formulation used in previous works not applicable. Second, the Transformer layer contains very distinct sub-layers. The self-attention sub-layer takes the information from all positions as input while the position-wise feed-forward layer is applied to each position separately. How to interpret these heterogeneous components by ODE is also not covered by previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Tao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Chen et al., 2018a</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>REFORMULATE TRANSFORMER LAYERS AS AN ODE SOLVER FOR MULTI-PARTICLE DYNAMIC SYSTEM</title><p>In this section, we first introduce the general form of differential equations in MPDS and then reformulate the stacked Transformer layers to show they form a numerical ODE solver for a specific problem. After that, we use advanced methods in the ODE theory to design new architectures.</p></sec><sec><title>MULTI-PARTICLE ODE AND ITS NUMERICAL SOLVER</title><p>Understanding the dynamics of multiple particles' movements in space is one of the important problems in physics, especially in fluid mechanics and astrophysics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Moulton, 2012</xref>). The behavior of each particle is usually modeled by two factors: The first factor concerns about the mechanism of its movement regardless of other particles, e.g., caused by an external force outside of the system, which is usually referred to as the convection; The second factor concerns about the movement resulting from other particles, which is usually referred to as the diffusion. Mathematically, assume there are n particles in d-dimensional space. Denote x i (t) &#8712; R d as the location of i-th particle at time t. The dynamics of particle i can be formulated as</p><p>Function F (x i (t), [x 1 (t), &#183; &#183; &#183; , x n (t)], t) represents the diffusion term which characterizes the inter- action between the particles. G(x, t) is a function which takes a location x and time t as input and represents the convection term.</p></sec><sec><title>Splitting schemes</title><p>As we can see, there are two coupled terms in the right-hand side of Eqn (5) describing different physical phenomena. Numerical methods of directly solving such ODEs can be complicated. The splitting method is a prevailing way of solving such coupled differential equations that can be decomposed into a sum of differential operators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">McLachlan &amp; Quispel, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, splitting convection from diffusion is quite standard for many convection-diffusion equations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Glowinski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Geiser, 2009</xref>). The Lie-Trotter splitting scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Geiser, 2009</xref>) is the simplest splitting method. It splits the right-hand side of Eqn (5) into function F (&#183;) and G(&#183;) and solves the individual dynamics alternatively. More precisely, to compute x i (t + &#947;) from x i (t), the Lie-Trotter splitting scheme with the Euler's method reads as</p><p>From time t to time t + &#947;, the Lie-Trotter splitting method first solves the ODE with respect to F (&#183;) and acquire an intermediate locationx i (t). Then, starting fromx i (t) , it solves the second ODE with respect to G(&#183;) to obtain x i (t + &#947;).</p></sec><sec><title>PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE TRANSFORMER</title><p>We reformulate the two sub-layers of the Transformer in order to match its form with the ODE described above. Denote x l = (x l,1 , . . . , x l,n ) as the input to the l-th Transformer layer, where n is the sequence length and x l,i is a real-valued vector in R d for any i.</p></sec><sec><title>Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020</title><p>Reformulation of the self-attention sub-layer Denotex l,i as the output of the (multi-head) self- attention sub-layer at position i with residual connections. The computation ofx l,i can be written asx</p><p>ij as a normalized value of the pair-wise dot product e (k) ij over j, we can generally reformulate Eqn (8) as</p><p>where W l att denotes all trainable parameters in the l-th self-attention sub-layer. Reformulation of the position-wise FFN sub-layer Next,x l,i is put into the position-wise FFN sub-layer with residual connections and output x l+1,i . The computation of x l+1,i can be written as x l+1,i =x l,i + FFN W l ffn (x l,i ), (11) where W l ffn denotes all trainable parameters in the l-th position-wise FFN sub-layer. Reformulation of Transformer layers Combining Eqn (10) and (11), we reformulate the Trans- former layers 1 asx</p><p>We can see that the Transformer layers (Eqn (12-13)) resemble the multi-particle ODE solver in Section 3.1 (Eqn (6-7)). Indeed, we can formally establish the link between the ODE solver with splitting scheme and stacked Transformer layers as below.</p><p>The Transformer can be viewed as a numerical ODE solver us- ing Lie-Trotter splitting scheme and the Euler's method (with time step &#947;) for Eqn (5) with F * and G * .</p><p>The above observation grants a physical interpretation of natural language processing and provides a new perspective on the Transformer architecture. First, this perspective provides a unified view of the heterogeneous components in the Transformer. The self-attention sub-layer is viewed as a diffusion term which characterizes the particle interactions while the position-wise feed-forward network sub-layer is viewed as a convection term. The two terms together naturally form the convection- diffusion equation in physics. Second, this interpretation advances our understanding of the latent representations of language through the Transformer. Viewing the feature (a.k.a., embedding) of words in a sequence as the initial position of particles, we can interpret the latent representations of the sentence abstracted by the Transformer as particles moving in a high-dimensional space as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_0">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Zhang, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>IMPROVING TRANSFORMER VIA STRANG-MARCHUK SPLITTING SCHEME</title><p>In the previous subsection, we have successfully mapped the Transformer architecture to a numerical ODE solver for MPDS. However, we would like to point out that one of the key components in this ODE solver, the Lie-Trotter splitting scheme, is the simplest one but has relatively high errors. In this 1 Layer normalization is sometimes applied to the sub-layers but recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Zhang et al., 2019a</xref>) shows that the normalization trick is not essential and can be removed. One can still readily check that the reformulation (Eqn (12) and (13)) still holds with layer normalization. subsection, we incorporate one of the most popular and widely used splitting scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Geiser, 2009</xref>), the Strang-Marchuk splitting scheme, into the design of the neural networks.</p><p>The Lie-Trotter splitting scheme solves the dynamics of F (&#183;) and G(&#183;) alternatively and exclusively in that order. This inevitably brings bias and leads to higher local truncation errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Geiser, 2009</xref>). To mitigate the bias, we use a simple modification to the Lie-Trotter splitting scheme by dividing the one-step numerical solver for G(&#183;) into two half-steps: we put one half-step before solving F (&#183;) and put the other half-step after solving F (&#183;). This modified splitting scheme is known as the Strang-Marchuk splitting scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Strang, 1968</xref>). Mathematically, to compute x i (t + &#947;) from x i (t), the Strang-Marchuk splitting scheme reads as</p><p>The Strang-Marchuk splitting scheme enjoys higher-order accuracy than the Lie-Trotter splitting scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bobylev &amp; Ohwada, 2001</xref>) in terms of the local truncation error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Ascher &amp; Petzold, 1998</xref>), which measures the per-step distance between the true solution and the approximated solution using numerical schemes. Mathematically, for a differential equation dx(t) dt = f (x, t) and a numerical scheme A, the local truncation error of numerical scheme A is defined as &#964; = x(t + &#947;) &#8722; A(x(t), &#947;). For example, when A is the Euler's method, &#964; Euler = x(t + &#947;) &#8722; x(t) &#8722; &#947;f (x(t), t). The order of local truncation error of the two schemes has been studied in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bobylev &amp; Ohwada (2001)</xref>, as shown in the following theorem. Theorem 1. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bobylev &amp; Ohwada, 2001</xref>) The local truncation error of the Lie-Trotter splitting scheme is second-order (O(&#947; 2 )) and the local truncation error of the Strang-Marchuk splitting scheme is third-order (O(&#947; 3 )).</p><p>For completeness, we provide the formal theorem with proof in the appendix. We can see from Eqn (14-16) that the Strang-Marchuk splitting scheme uses a three-step process to solve the ODE. Mapped to neural network design, the Strang-Marchuk splitting scheme (together with the Euler's method) suggests there should also be three sub-layers instead of the two sub-layers in the Transformer. By replacing function &#947;F and &#947;G by MultiHeadAtt and FFN, we hav&#7869;</p><p>From Eqn (17-19), we can see that the new layer composes of three sub-layers. Each hidden vector at different positions will first pass through the first position-wise FFN sub-layer with a half-step 2 residual connection (" 1 2 " in Eqn (17)), and then the output vectors will be feed into a self-attention sub-layer. In the last step, the output vectors from the self-attention sub-layer will be put into the second position-wise FFN sub-layer with a half-step residual connection. Since the FFN-attention- FFN structure is "Macaron"-like, we call the layer as Macaron layer and call the network using Macaron layers as Macaron Net, as shown in Figure 2(b). Previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>) have successfully demonstrated that the neural network architectures inspired by higher-order accurate numerical ODE solvers will lead to better results in deep learning and we believe the Macaron Net can achieve better performance on practical natural language processing applications than the Transformer.</p></sec><sec><title>EXPERIMENTS</title><p>We test our proposed Macaron architectures in both supervised and unsupervised learning setting. For the supervised learning setting, we use IWLST14 and WMT14 machine translation datasets. For the unsupervised learning setting, we pretrain the model using the same method as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Devlin et al. (2018)</xref> and test the learned model over a set of downstream tasks.

Both of them consist of a 6-layer encoder and 6-layer decoder. The size of the hidden nodes and embeddings are set to 512 for base and 1024 for big. The number of heads are 8 for base and 16 for big. Since the IWSLT14 dataset is much smaller than the WMT14 dataset, the small setting is usually used, whose size of hidden states and embeddings is set to 512 and the number of heads is set to 4. For all settings, the dimensionality of the inner-layer of the position-wise FFN is four times of the dimensionality of the hidden states.</p><p>For each setting (base, big and small), we replace all Transformer layers by the Macaron layers 3 and obtain the base, big and small Macaron, each of which contains two position-wise feed- Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 Unsupervised Pretraining BERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Devlin et al., 2018</xref>) is the current state-of-the-art pre-trained contextual representation model based on a multi-layer Transformer encoder architecture and trained by masked language modeling and next-sentence prediction tasks.

The size of hidden states and embeddings are set to 768, and the number of attention heads is set to 12. Similarly, we replace the Transformer layers in BERT base by the Macaron layers and reduce the dimensionality of the inner-layer of the two FFN sub-layers by half, and thus we keep the number of parameters of our Macaron base same as BERT base.</p></sec><sec><title>EXPERIMENT RESULTS</title></sec><sec><title>Machine Translation</title><p>We use BLEU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Papineni et al., 2002</xref>) as the evaluation measure for machine translation.

Due to that some pieces of data used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Devlin et al. (2018)</xref> are no longer freely distributed, the two numbers are slightly different. We can see from the table, our proposed Macaron Net base outperforms all baselines in terms of the general GLUE score. Specifically, given the same dataset, our proposed model outperforms our trained BERT base model in all tasks. Even comparing with the BERT base model in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Devlin et al. (2018)</xref>, our model performs better in 6 out of 8 tasks and achieves close performance in the rest 2 tasks. As a summary, the improvement in both machine translation and GLUE tasks well aligns with the ODE theory and our proposed architecture performs better than the Transformer in real practice.</p></sec><sec><title>ADDITIONAL COMPARISONS</title><p>As we can see, the main difference between Macaron Net and the Transformer is that Macaron Net uses two FFN sub-layers in a layer block while the Transformer just uses one. One may argue that the improvements of the new architecture may be simply due to adding nonlinearities but not from ODE theory. We point out here that adding nonlinearities does not always guarantee improvements in deep learning. For example, feed-forward neural networks contain much more nonlinearities than convolutional neural networks but the performance of feed-forward neural networks is superior than that of convolutional neural networks in image classification. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Wu et al. (2019b)</xref> shows that simply adding nonlinearities by stacking more Transformer layers does not work well in practice.</p><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of our network, we further conducted experiments to show the ODE- inspired way of adding nonlinearities is better than following heuristic methods:</p><p>&#8226; Att-FFN-Att: In Macaron Net, we use two FFN sub-layers and one attention sub-layer in a layer. Here we construct a baseline that uses two attention sub-layers and one FFN sub-layer layer. Note that the attention sub-layer also contains nonlinearities in the softmax and dot-product operations.</p><p>&#8226; No residual: In the Transformer, the FFN sub-layer has one hidden layer. We changed it to two hidden layers without residual connections, which increases the nonlinearities.</p><p>We compare these two models with Macaron Net on WMT14 En-De task and keep all the model parameters to be the same as the Transformer big setting. We list the performance of different models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab_2">Table 3</xref>. We can see that the BLEU scores of two models are 28.6/28.3 respectively. As a comparison, the BLEU score of Macaron Net is 30.2. We also cite the results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Wu et al. (2019b)</xref>, which shows that simply stacking more Transformer layers cannot reach comparable performance. Therefore, we believe our ODE-inspired architecture design is principled and better than heuristics, which provides a better understanding to the Transformer model.</p><p>Furthermore, we can also see that the empirical results are consistent with the ODE theories. The step size &#947; in ODE relates to #layers in deep learning. In detail, a small step size &#947; maps to a large value of #layer: a neural network with more layers stacked corresponds to an ODE solver with smaller step size &#947;. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab_0">Table 1</xref> and 2, we can see that that given the same step size &#947; (#layers), our Macaron Net is better than the Transformer. Results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Wu et al. (2019b)</xref> show that even using a smaller &#947; (8-layer or 10-layer Transformer), our Macaron Net (6-layer) is still better. These results are consistent with ODE theories: (1) A higher-order ODE solver is better given the same step size (6-layer Macaron Net v.s. 6-layer Transformer). (2) The order matters, a higher-order ODE solver works well even using a relatively larger step size (6-layer Macaron Net v.s. 10-layer Transformer).</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</title><p>In this paper, we interpret the Transformer as a numerical ODE solver for a convection-diffusion equation in a multi-particle dynamic system. Specifically, how words in a sentence are abstracted into contexts by passing through the layers of the Transformer can be interpreted as approximating multiple particles' movement in the space using the Lie-Trotter splitting scheme and the Euler's method. By replacing the Lie-Trotter splitting scheme with the more advanced Strang-Marchuk Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 splitting scheme, we obtain a new architecture. The improvements in real applications show the effectiveness of the new model and are consistent with the ODE theory. In the future, we will explore deeper connections between the ODE theory and the Transformer models and use the ODE theory to improve the individual components in the Transformer architecture such as attention modules.</p></sec><sec id="figures"><title>Figures</title><fig id="fig_0"><object-id>fig_0</object-id><label>Figure 1:</label><caption><title>Figure 1:</title><p>Physical interpretation of Transformer.</p></caption><graphic /><graphic /></fig><fig id="fig_1"><object-id>fig_1</object-id><label>Figure 2:</label><caption><title>Figure 2:</title><p>The Transformer and our Macaron architectures.</p></caption><graphic /><graphic /></fig><table-wrap id="tab_0"><label>Table 1:</label><caption><title>Table 1:</title><p>Translation performance (BLEU) on IWSLT14 De-En and WMT14 En-De testsets.</p></caption><table><tbody><tr><td /></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tab_1"><label>Table 2:</label><caption><title>Table 2:</title><p>Test results on the GLUE benchmark (except WNLI).</p></caption><table><tbody><tr><td /></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tab_2"><label>Table 3:</label><caption><title>Table 3:</title><p>Additional Comparisions on WMT14 En-De translation tasks.</p></caption><table><tbody><tr><td /></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></body><back><sec><p>The translation model is based on the encoder-decoder framework. In the Transformer, the decoder layer has a third sub-layer which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack (encoder-decoder- attention) and a mask to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. In our implementation of Macaron decoder, we also use masks and split the FFN into two sub-layers and thus our decoder layer is (FFN, self-attention, encoder-decoder-attention, and FFN).</p></sec><ref-list id="ref-list-1"><ref id="b0"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Weighted transformer network for machine translation</article-title><source>arXiv

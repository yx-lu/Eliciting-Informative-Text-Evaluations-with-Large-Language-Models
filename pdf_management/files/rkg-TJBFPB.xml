Instead of solely relying on extrinsic rewards provided by the environment, many state-of-the-art methods use intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration. However, we show that existing methods fall short in procedurally-generated environments where an agent is unlikely to visit a state more than once. We propose a novel type of intrinsic reward which encourages the agent to take actions that lead to significant changes in its learned state represen- tation. We evaluate our method on multiple challenging procedurally-generated tasks in MiniGrid, as well as on tasks with high-dimensional observations used in prior work. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach is more sample ef- ficient than existing exploration methods, particularly for procedurally-generated MiniGrid environments. Furthermore, we analyze the learned behavior as well as the intrinsic reward received by our agent. In contrast to previous approaches, our intrinsic reward does not diminish during the course of training and it rewards the agent substantially more for interacting with objects that it can control.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most popular frameworks for developing agents that can solve a wide range of complex tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Mnih et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Silver et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">2017</xref>). RL agents learn to act in new environments through trial and error, in an attempt to maximize their cumulative reward. However, many environments of interest, particularly those closer to real-world problems, do not provide a steady stream of rewards for agents to learn from. In such settings, agents require many episodes to come across any reward, often rendering standard RL methods inapplicable. Inspired by human learning, the use of intrinsic motivation has been proposed to encourage agents to learn about their environments even when extrinsic feedback is rarely provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Schmidhuber, 1991b</xref>; 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Oudeyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Oudeyer &amp; Kaplan, 2009</xref>). This type of exploration bonus emboldens the agent to visit new states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bellemare et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Burda et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Ecoffet et al., 2019</xref>) or to improve its knowledge and forward prediction of the world dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Pathak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Burda et al., 2019a</xref>), and can be highly effective for learning in hard exploration games such as Montezuma's Revenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Mnih et al., 2016</xref>). However, most hard exploration environments used in previous work have either a limited state space or an easy way to measure similarity between states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Ecoffet et al., 2019</xref>) and generally use the same "singleton" environment for training and evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Mnih et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Burda et al., 2019a</xref>). Deep RL agents trained in this way are prone to overfitting to a specific environment and often struggle to generalize to even slightly different settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Rajeswaran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Zhang et al., 2018a</xref>;b). As a first step towards addressing this problem, a number of procedurally-generated environments have been recently released, for example DeepMind Lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Beattie et al., 2016</xref>), Sokoban (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Racani&#232;re et al., 2017</xref>), Malm&#246; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>), CraftAssist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Jernite et al., 2019</xref>), Sonic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Nichol et al., 2018</xref>), CoinRun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Cobbe et al., 2019</xref>), Obstacle Tower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Juliani et al., 2019</xref>), or Capture the Flag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Jaderberg et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we investigate exploration in procedurally-generated sparse-reward environments. Throughout the paper, we will refer to the general problem that needs to be solved as the task</p><p>(e.g. find a goal inside a maze) and to the particular instantiation of this task as the environment (e.g. maze layout, colors, textures, locations of the objects, environment dynamics etc.). The environment can be singleton or procedurally-generated. Singleton environments are those in which the agent has to solve the same task in the same environment in every episode, i.e.., the environment does not change between episodes. A popular example of a hard exploration environment that falls into that category is Montezuma's Revenge. In procedurally-generated environments, the agent needs to solve the same task, but in every episode the environment is constructed differently (e.g. resulting in a different maze layout), making it unlikely for an agent to ever visit the same state twice. Thus, agents in such environments have to learn policies that generalize well across a very large state space. We demonstrate that current exploration methods fall short in such environments as they (i) make strong assumptions about the environment (deterministic or resettable to previous states) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Ecoffet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aytar et al., 2018</xref>), (ii) make strong assumptions about the state space (small number of different states or easy to determine if two states are similar) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Ecoffet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Burda et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bellemare et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Ostrovski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Machado et al., 2018a</xref>), or (iii) provide intrinsic rewards that can diminish quickly during training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Pathak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Burda et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p>To overcome these limitations, we propose Rewarding Impact-Driven Exploration (RIDE), a novel intrinsic reward for exploration in RL that encourages the agent to take actions which result in impactful changes to its representation of the environment state (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_0">Figure 1</xref> for an illustration). We compare against state-of-the-art intrinsic reward methods on singleton environments with high- dimensional observations (i.e. visual inputs), as well as on hard-exploration tasks in procedurally- generated grid-world environments. Our experiments show that RIDE outperforms state-of-the-art exploration methods, particularly in procedurally-generated environments. Furthermore, we present a qualitative analysis demonstrating that RIDE, in contrast to prior work, does not suffer from diminishing intrinsic rewards during training and encourages agents substantially more to interact with objects that they can control (relative to other state-action pairs).</p></sec><sec><title>RELATED WORK</title><p>The problem of exploration in reinforcement learning has been extensively studied.

The most popular and effective kinds of intrinsic motivation can be split into two broad classes: count-based methods that encourage the agent to visit novel states and curiosity-based methods that encourage the agent to learn about the environment dynamics.</p><p>Count-Based Exploration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Strehl &amp; Littman (2008)</xref> proposed the use of state visitation counts as an exploration bonus in tabular settings. More recently, such methods were extended to high- dimensional state spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bellemare et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Ostrovski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Martin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Tang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Machado et al., 2018a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bellemare et al.

(2019b)</xref> employ the prediction error of a random network as explo- ration bonus with the aim of rewarding novel states more than previously seen ones. However, one can expect count-based exploration methods to be less effective in procedurally-generated environ- ments with sparse reward. In these settings, the agent is likely to characterize two states as being different even when they only differ by features that are irrelevant for the task (e.g. the texture of the walls). If the agent considers most states to be "novel", the feedback signal will not be distinctive or varied enough to guide the agent.</p></sec><sec><title>Curiosity-Driven Exploration</title><p>Curiosity-based bonuses encourage the agent to explore the en- vironment to learn about its dynamics. Curiosity can be formulated as the error or uncertainty in predicting the consequences of the agent's actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Stadie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Pathak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Burda et al., 2019b</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Pathak et al. (2017)</xref> learn a latent representation of the state and design an intrinsic reward based on the error of predicting the next state in the learned latent space. While we use a similar mechanism for learning state embeddings, our exploration bonus is very different and builds upon the difference between the latent representations of two consecutive states. As we will see in the following sections, one problem with their approach is that the intrinsic reward can vanish during training, leaving the agent with no incentive to further explore the environment and reducing its feedback to extrinsic reward only.</p></sec><sec><title>Generalization in Deep RL</title><p>Most of the existing exploration methods that have achieved impres- sive results on difficult tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Ecoffet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Pathak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Burda et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bellemare et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aytar et al., 2018</xref>), have been trained and tested on the same environ- ment and thus do not generalize to new instances. Several recent papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Rajeswaran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Zhang et al., 2018a</xref>;b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Machado et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Foley et al., 2018</xref>) demonstrate that deep RL is sus- ceptible to severe overfitting. As a result, a number of benchmarks have been recently released for testing generalization in RL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Beattie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Cobbe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Packer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Justesen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Leike et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Nichol et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Juliani et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we make another step towards developing exploration methods that can generalize to unseen scenarios by evaluating them on procedurally-generated environments. We opted for MiniGrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018</xref>) because it is fast to run, provides a standard set of tasks with varied difficulty levels, focuses on single-agent, and does not use visual inputs, thereby allowing us to better isolate the exploration problem.</p><p>More closely related to our work are the papers of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Marino et al. (2019)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Zhang et al. (2019)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Marino et al. (2019)</xref> use a reward that encourages changing the values of the non-proprioceptive features for training low-level policies on locomotion tasks. Their work assumes that the agent has access to a decomposition of the observation state into internal and external parts, an assumption which may not hold in many cases and may not be trivial to obtain even if it exists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Zhang et al. (2019)</xref> use the difference between the successor features of consecutive states as intrinsic reward. In this framework, a state is characterized through the features of all its successor states. While both of these papers use fixed (i.e. not learned) state representations to define the intrinsic reward, we use forward and inverse dynamics models to learn a state representation constrained to only capture elements in the environment that can be influenced by the agent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Lesort et al. (2018)</xref> emphasize the benefits of using a learned state representation for control as opposed to a fixed one (which may not contain information relevant for acting in the environment). In the case of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Zhang et al. (2019)</xref>, constructing a temporally extended state representation for aiding exploration is not trivial. Such a feature space may add extra noise to the intrinsic reward due to the uncertainty of future states. This is particularly problematic when the environment is highly stochastic or the agent often encounters novel states (as it is the case in procedurally-generated environments).</p></sec><sec><title>BACKGROUND: CURIOSITY-DRIVEN EXPLORATION</title><p>We use the standard formalism of a single agent Markov Decision Process (MDP) defined by a set of states S, a set of actions A, and a transition function T : S &#215; A &#8594; P(S) providing the probability distribution of the next state given a current state and action. The agent chooses actions by sampling from a stochastic policy &#960; : S &#8594; P(A), and receives reward r : S &#215; A &#8594; R at every time step. The agent's goal is to learn a policy which maximizes its discounted expected return R t = E T k=0 &#947; k r t+k+1 where r t is the sum of the intrinsic and extrinsic reward received by the agent at time t, &#947; &#8712; [0, 1] is the discount factor, and the expectation is taken with respect to both the policy and the environment. Here, we consider the case of episodic RL in which the agent maximizes the reward received within a finite time horizon.</p><p>In this paper we consider that, along with the extrinsic reward r e t , the agent also receives some intrinsic reward r i t , which can be computed for any (s t , a t , s t+1 ) tuple. Consequently, the agent tries to maximize the weighted sum of the intrinsic and extrinsic reward: r t = r e t + &#969; ir r i t where &#969; ir is a hyperparameter to weight the importance of both rewards.</p><p>We built upon the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Pathak et al. (2017)</xref> who note that some parts of the observation may have no influence on the agent's state. Thus, Pathak et al. propose learning a state representation that disregards those parts of the observation and instead only models (i) the elements that the agent can control, as well as (ii) those that can affect the agent, even if the agent cannot have an effect on them. Concretely, Pathak et al. learn a state representations &#966;(s) = f emb (s; &#952; emb ) of a state s using an inverse and a forward dynamics model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_0">Figure 1</xref>). The forward dynamics model is a neural network parametrized by &#952; f w that takes as inputs &#966;(s t ) and a t , predicts the next state representation:&#966;(s t+1 ) = f f w (&#966; t , a t ; &#952; f w ), and it is trained to minimize L f w (&#952; f w , &#952; emb ) = &#966; (s t+1 ) &#8722; &#966;(s t+1 ) 2 2 . The inverse dynamics model is also a neural network parameterized by &#952; inv that takes as inputs &#966;(s t ) and &#966;(s t+1 ), predicts the agent's action:&#226; t = f inv (&#966; t , &#966; t+1 ; &#952; inv ), and it is trained to minimize L inv (&#952; inv , &#952; emb ) = CrossEntropy(&#226; t , a t ) when the action space is discrete. Pathak et al.'s curiosity-based intrinsic reward is proportional to the squared Euclidean distance between the actual embedding of the next state &#966;(s t+1 ) and the one predicted by the forward model&#966;(s t+1 ).</p></sec><sec><title>IMPACT-DRIVEN EXPLORATION</title><p>Our main contribution is a novel intrinsic reward based on the change in the state representation produced by the agent's action. The proposed method encourages the agent to try out actions that have a significant impact on the environment. We demonstrate that this approach can promote effective exploration strategies when the feedback from the environment is sparse.</p><p>We train a forward and an inverse dynamics model to learn a latent state representation &#966;(s) as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Pathak et al. (2017)</xref>. However, instead of using the Euclidean distance between the predicted next state representation and the actual next state representation as intrinsic reward (R cur in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_0">Figure 1</xref>), we define impact-driven reward as the Euclidean distance between consecutive state representations (R IDE in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_0">Figure 1</xref>). Compared to curiosity-driven exploration, impact-driven ex- ploration rewards the agent for very different state-actions, leading to distinct agent behaviors which we analyze in Section 6.1.1. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Stanton &amp; Clune (2018)</xref> categorize exploration into: across-training and intra-life and argue they are complementary. Popular methods such as count-based exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bellemare et al., 2016</xref>) encour- age agents to visit novel states in relation to all prior training episodes (i.e. across-training novelty), but they do not consider whether an agent visits novel states within some episode (i.e. intra-life novelty). As we will see, RIDE combines both types of exploration.</p><p>Formally, RIDE is computed as the L 2 -norm &#966;(s t+1 ) &#8722; &#966;(s t ) 2 of the difference in the learned state representation between consecutive states. However, to ensure that the agent does not go back and forth between a sequence of states (with a large difference in their embeddings) in order to gain intrinsic reward, we discount RIDE by episodic state visitation counts. Concretely, we divide the impact-driven reward by N ep (s t+1 ), where N ep (s t+1 ) is the number of times that state has been visited during the current episode, which is initialized to 1 in the beginning of the episode. In high- Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 dimensional regimes, one can use episodic pseudo-counts instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bellemare et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Ostrovski et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the overall intrinsic reward provided by RIDE is calculated as: R IDE (s t , a t ) &#8801; r i t (s t , a t ) = &#966;(s t+1 ) &#8722; &#966;(s t ) 2 N ep (s t+1 ) where &#966;(s t+1 ) and &#966;(s t ) are the learned representations of consecutive states, resulting from the agent transitioning to state s t+1 after taking action a t in state s t . The state is projected into a latent space using a neural network with parameters &#952; emb .</p><p>The overall optimization problem that is solved for training the agent is min</p><p>where &#952; &#960; are the parameters of the policy and value network (a t &#8764; &#960;(s t ; &#952; &#960; )), and &#969; &#960; , &#969; inv and &#969; f w are scalars that weigh the relative importance of the reinforcement learning (RL) loss to that of the inverse and forward dynamics losses which are used for learning the intrinsic reward signal. Note that we never update the parameters of the inverse (&#952; inv ), forward (&#952; f w ), or embedding networks (&#952; emb ) using the signal from the intrinsic or extrinsic reward (i.e. the RL loss); we only use these learned state embeddings for constructing the exploration bonus and never as part of the agent's policy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_0">Figure 1</xref> highlights that the policy learns its own internal representation of the state &#968; t , which is only used for control and never for computing the intrinsic reward). Otherwise, the agent can artificially maximize its intrinsic reward by constructing state representations with large distances among themselves, without grounding them in environment observations.</p><p>Note that there is no incentive for the learned state representations to encode features of the envi- ronment that cannot be influenced by the agent's actions. Thus, our agent will not receive rewards for reaching states that are inherently unpredictable, making exploration robust with respect to dis- tractor objects or other inconsequential sources of variation in the environment. As we will later show, RIDE is robust to the well-known noisy-TV problem in which an agent, that is rewarded for errors in the prediction of its forward model (such as the one proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Pathak et al. (2017)</xref>), gets attracted to local sources of entropy in the environment. Furthermore, the difference of consecutive state representations is unlikely to go to zero during learning as they are representations of actual states visited by the agent and constrained by the forward and inverse model. This is in contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Pathak et al. (2017)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Burda et al. (2019b)</xref> where the intrinsic reward goes to zero as soon as the forward model becomes sufficiently accurate or the agent's policy only explores well known parts of the state space. We evaluate RIDE on procedurally-generated environments from MiniGrid, as well as on two existing singleton environments with high-dimensional observations used in prior work, and compare it against both standard RL and three commonly used intrinsic re- ward methods for exploration. For all our experiments, we show the mean and standard deviation of the average return across 5 dif- ferent seeds for each model. The average return is computed as the rolling mean over the past 100 episodes.</p></sec><sec><title>ENVIRONMENTS</title><p>The first set of environments are procedurally-generated grid- worlds in MiniGrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Chevalier-Boisvert et al., 2018</xref>).

Each tile in the grid contains at most one of the following objects: wall, door, key, ball, box and goal. The agent can take one of seven actions: turn left or right, move forward, pick up or drop an object, toggle or done. More details about the MiniGrid environment and tasks can be found in A.3.

Note that the standard RL approach IMPALA (purple) is not able to learn in any of the environments since the extrinsic reward is too sparse. Furthermore, our results reveal that RIDE is more sample efficient compared to all the other exploration methods across all MiniGrid tasks considered here. While other exploration bonuses seem effective on easier tasks and are able to learn optimal policies where IMPALA fails, the gap between our approach and the others is increasing with the difficulty of the task. Furthermore, RIDE manages to solve some very challenging tasks on which the other methods fail to get any reward even after training on over 100M frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 3</xref>). In addition to existing MiniGrid tasks, we also tested the model's ability to deal with stochasticity in the environment by adding a "noisy TV" in the MiniGridN7S4 task, resulting in the new Mini- GirdN7S4NoisyTV task (left-center plot in the top row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 3</xref>). The noisy TV is implemented as a ball that changes its color to a randomly picked one whenever the agent takes a particular action. As expected, the performance of ICM drops as the agent becomes attracted to the ball while obtain- ing intrinsic rewarded for not being able to predict the next color. The Count model also needs more time to train, likely caused by the increasing number of rare and novel states (due to the changing color of the ball).</p><p>We include results for ablations to our model in Appendix A.5, highlighting the importance of combining impact-driven exploration with episodic state visitation discounting.</p></sec><sec><title>ANALYSIS OF THE INTRINSIC REWARD</title><p>To better understand the effectiveness of different exploration methods, we investigate the intrinsic reward an agent receives for certain trajectories in the environment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 4</xref> shows a heatmap of the intrinsic reward received by RND, ICM, and RIDE on a sam- pled environment after having been trained on procedurally-generated environments from the Mul- tiRoomN7S4 task. While all three methods can solve this task, the intrinsic rewards received are different. Specifically, the RIDE agent is rewarded in a much more structured manner for opening doors, entering new rooms and turning at decision points. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab_0">Table 1</xref> provides quantitative numbers for this phenomenon. We record the intrinsic rewards received for each type of action, averaged over 100 episodes. We found that RIDE is putting more emphasis on actions interacting with the door than for moving forward or turning left or right, while the other methods reward actions more uniformly. Figure 12 and Table 3 in A.6.2 show a similar pattern for the intrinsic rewards for agents trained on the MultiRoomN12S10 task, while Figure 13 and Table 4 in A.6.3 contain the equivalent analysis for agents trained on ObstructedMaze2Dlh. As emphasized there, RIDE is rewarding the agent more for interactions with objects as opposed to actions for moving around in the maze, a characteristic which is not as prevalent in the other models. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_4">Figure 5</xref> shows the mean intrinsic reward of all models while training on the MultiRoomN12S10 task. While the ICM, RND, and Count intrinsic reward converges to very low val- ues quite early in the training process, the RIDE bonus keeps changing and has a higher value even after training on 100M frames. Hence, RIDE constantly encourages the agent to take actions that change the local environment. In contrast, Count, RND, and Curiosity may not consider certain states to be "novel" or "surprising" after longer periods of training as they have seen similar states in the past or learned to almost perfectly predict the next state in a subset of the environment states. Consequently, their intrinsic rewards diminish during training and the agent struggles to distinguish between actions that lead to novel or surprising states from those that do not, thereby getting trapped in some parts of the state space (see Figure 12).</p></sec><sec><title>SINGLETON VERSUS PROCEDURALLY-GENERATED ENVIRONMENTS</title><p>It is important to understand and quantify how much harder it is to train existing deep RL exploration methods on tasks in procedurally-generated environments compared to a singleton environment.</p><p>To investigate this dependency, we trained the models on a singleton environment of the the ObstructedMaze2Dlh task so that at the beginning of every episode, the agent is spawned in exactly the same maze with all objects located in the same positions. In this setting, we see that Count, RND, and IM- PALA are also able to solve the task (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_5">Figure 6</xref> and com- pare with the center-right plot in the bottom row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Fig- ure 3</xref> for procedurally-generated environments of the same task). As expected, this emphasizes that training an agent in procedurally-generated environments creates significant chal- lenges over training on a singleton environment for the same task. Moreover, it highlights the importance of training on a variety of environments to avoid overfitting to the idiosyn- crasies of a particular environment.</p></sec><sec><title>NO EXTRINSIC REWARD</title><p>To analyze the way different methods explore environments without depending on the chance of run- ning into extrinsic reward (which can dramatically change the agent's policy), we analyze agents that are trained without any extrinsic reward on both singleton and procedurally-generated environments. The top row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 7</xref> shows state visitation heatmaps for all the models in a singleton environment on the MultiRoomN10S6 task, after training all of them for 50M frames with intrinsic reward only. The agents are allowed to take 200 steps in every episode. The figure indicates that all models have effective exploration strategies when trained on a singleton maze, the 10th, 9th and 6th rooms are reached by RIDE, Count/RND, and ICM, respectively. The Random policy fully explores the first room but does not get to the second room within the time limit.</p><p>When trained on procedurally-generated mazes, existing models are exploring much less efficiently as can be seen in the bottom row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_6">Figure 7</xref>. Here, Count, RND, and ICM only make it to the 4th, 3rd and 2nd rooms respectively within an episode, while RIDE is able to explore all rooms. This Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 Count RND ICM Random RIDE further supports that RIDE learns a state representation that allows generalization across different mazes and is not as distracted by less important details that change from one procedurally-generated environment to another.</p></sec><sec><title>MARIO AND VIZDOOM</title><p>In order to compare to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Pathak et al. (2017)</xref>, we evaluate RIDE on the first level of the Mario envi- ronment. Our results (see Figure 8 a and b) suggest that this environment may not be as challenging as previously believed, given that all the methods evaluated here, including vanilla IMPALA, can learn similarly good policies after training on only 1m frames even without any intrinsic reward (left figure). Note that we are able to reproduce the results mentioned in the original ICM paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Pathak et al., 2017</xref>). However, when training with both intrinsic and extrinsic reward (center figure), the curiosity-based exploration bonus (ICM) hurts learning, converging later and to a lower value than the other methods evaluated here.</p><p>For VizDoom (see Figure 8 c) we observe that RIDE performs as well as ICM, while all the other baselines fail to learn effective policies given the same amount of training. Note that our ICM implementation can reproduce the results in the original paper on this task, achieving a 100% success rate after training on approximately 60m frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Pathak et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</title><p>In this work, we propose Rewarding Impact-Driven Exploration (RIDE), an intrinsic reward bonus that encourages agents to explore actions that substantially change the state of the environment, as measured in a learned latent space. RIDE has a number of desirable properties: it attracts agents to states where they can affect the environment, it provides a signal to agents even after training for a long time, and it is conceptually simple as well as compatible with other intrinsic or extrinsic rewards and any deep RL algorithm.</p><p>Our approach is particularly effective in procedurally-generated sparse-reward environments where it significantly outperforms IMPALA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Espeholt et al., 2018</xref>), as well as some of the most popu- lar exploration methods such as Count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bellemare et al., 2016</xref>), RND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Burda et al., 2019b</xref>), and ICM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Pathak et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, RIDE explores procedurally-generated environments more efficiently than other exploration methods.</p><p>However, there are still many ways to improve upon RIDE. For example, one can make use of sym- bolic information to measure or characterize the agent's impact, consider longer-term effects of the agent's actions, or promote diversity among the kinds of changes the agent makes to the environ- ment. Another interesting avenue for future research is to develop algorithms that can distinguish between desirable and undesirable types of impact the agent can have in the environment, thus con- straining the agent to act safely and avoid distractions (i.e. actions that lead to large changes in the environment but that are not useful for a given task). The different kinds of impact might corre- spond to distinctive skills or low-level policies that a hierarchical controller could use to learn more complex policies or better exploration strategies.</p></sec><sec id="figures"><title>Figures</title><fig id="fig_0"><object-id>fig_0</object-id><label>Figure 1:</label><caption><title>Figure 1:</title><p>RIDE rewards the agent for actions that have an impact on the state representation (R IDE ), which is learned using both a forward (L f w ) and an inverse dynamics (L inv ) model.</p></caption><graphic /></fig><fig id="fig_1"><object-id>fig_1</object-id><label>Figure 2:</label><caption><title>Figure 2:</title><p>Rendering of a procedurally-generated en- vironment from MiniGrid's MultiRoomN12S10 task.</p></caption><graphic /><graphic /></fig><fig id="fig_2"><object-id>fig_2</object-id><label>Figure 3:</label><caption><title>Figure 3:</title><p>Performance of RIDE, Count, RND, ICM and IMPALA on a variety of hard exploration problems in MiniGrid.

Different from explicit density estimation based models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Kingma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Oord et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Hinton, 2012</xref>), GANs are implicit generative models with two neural networks playing min-max game to find a map from random noise to target distribution, in which the generator tries to generate fake samples to fool discriminator and the discriminator tries to distinguish them from real samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Goodfellow et al., 2014</xref>). In original GANs formula, optimal discriminator measures the Jensen-Shannon divergence between real data distribution and generated distribution. The discrep- ancy measure can be generalized to f-divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Nowozin et al., 2016</xref>) or replaced by earth-mover distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Arjovsky et al., 2017</xref>). Despite the success, GANs are notoriously difficult to train(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kodali et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Arjovsky &amp; Bottou, 2017</xref>), which are very sensitive to hyper-parameters. When the support of these two distributions are approximately disjoint, gradient given by discriminator with standard objective may vanish, and training becomes unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Arjovsky et al., 2017</xref>). More seri- ously, generated distribution can fail to cover the whole data distribution and collapse to a single mode in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Dumoulin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Che et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The condition of discriminator determines the training stability and performance to a great extent. On the one hand, representation capacity of discriminator realized by a neural network is not infinite. Meanwhile, the discriminator is usually not optimal to measure true discrepancy when trained in an alternative manner practically. On the other hand, discriminator as a classifier is also vulnerable to adversarial samples (Appendix D): benign samples added by imperceptible perturbation can mis- lead classifier to give wrong prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Szegedy et al., 2014</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Goodfellow et al., 2015</xref>). Adversarial samples can be easily crafted by gradient-based method such as Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Goodfellow et al., 2015</xref>) or Basic Iterative Method (BIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Kurakin et al., 2017</xref>). It should be noted that the gradient given by discriminator that guides update of the generator is exactly the same as gradient used to craft adversarial samples of the discriminator. In other words, the gradi- ent contains uninformative adversarial noise which is imperceptible but can mislead the generator. However, generator can still generate meaningful samples in classic GANs training procedure. This Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 is because discriminator is adversarially trained with diverse generated fake samples. Nevertheless, adversarial training on real samples does not exist in classic training framework. As a consequence, training will become unstable when generated distribution approximates target distribution because the gradient given by non-robust discriminator around real samples contains more adversarial noise. To this end, we introduce adversarial training on real samples into classic GANs training framework to further improve the robustness of discriminator, which can reduce adversarial noise contained in gradient. It can be proved by results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_0">Figure 1</xref> empirically that the noise in gradient of adversarially trained discriminator is partly eliminated. Meanwhile, our proposed method can regularize the capability discriminator by performing adversarial training both on real samples and fake samples to alleviate training collapse. We validate the proposed method on image generation tasks with widely adopted DCGAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Radford et al., 2015</xref>) and ResNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">He et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gulrajani et al., 2017</xref>) architecture, which shows consistent improvement of training stability and acceleration of convergence. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to consider GANs from the perspective of adversarial samples, besides which we make GANs training scheme symmetric and improve per- formance efficiently with acceptable computation cost. We term the proposed method as adversarial symmetric GAN (AS-GAN).</p></sec><sec><title>RELATED WORK</title><p>There is a large body of work on how to stabilize GANs training and alleviate mode collapse. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Ar- jovsky &amp; Bottou, 2017</xref>) proved that the widely adopted non-saturating loss function for the gener- ator can be decomposed into Kullback-Leibler divergence minus two Jensen-Shannon divergence when discriminator trained to be optimal, which accounts for training instability and mode dropping during GANs training. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Metz et al., 2016</xref>) proposed to unroll the optimization of discriminator as surrogate objective to guide update of the generator, which shows improvement of training stability with relatively large computation overhead. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Kodali et al., 2018</xref>) claimed that the existence of unde- sirable local equilibria is responsible for mode collapse and proposed to regularize the discriminator around real data samples with gradient penalty.</p><p>Integral probability metric (IPM) based GANs such as Wasserstein GAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Arjovsky et al., 2017</xref>) and its variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gulrajani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Wu et al., 2018</xref>) can solve gradient vanishing in GANs training theoretically but it is not simple to make discriminator 1-Lipschitz required by the duality conversion practically. Wasserstein GAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Arjovsky et al., 2017</xref>) suggests earth-mover (EM) distance as a measure of discrepancy between two distributions and adopts weight clip to make the discriminator 1-Lipschitz constrained. WGAN-GP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gulrajani et al., 2017</xref>) adopts gradient penalty to regularize discriminator in a less rigorous way, but it requires calculation of the second order derivative with remarkable computation overhead. Spectral normalization on the weight of discriminator proposed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Miyato et al., 2018</xref>) can make discriminator 1-Lipschitz constrained efficiently, but capacity of discriminator is significantly constrained.</p></sec><sec><title>Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020</title><p>Adversarial vulnerability is an intriguing property of neural network-based classifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Szegedy et al., 2014</xref>). A well-trained neural network can give totally wrong prediction to adversarial samples that human can recognize accurately. Small-magnitude adversarial perturbation added to benign data can be easily calculated based on gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Goodfellow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Carlini &amp; Wagner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Dong et al., 2018</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Goodfellow et al., 2015</xref>) proposed to augment training data with adversarial samples to improve the robustness of neural networks, which can smooth the decision boundary of classi- fier around training samples. Gradient of adversarially trained classifier contains more semantic information and less adversarial noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Tsipras et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Kim et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Some work tried to craft or defense against adversarial samples using GANs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b0">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>) proposed to generate adversarial samples efficiently with GANs, in which a generator is used to generate adversarial perturbation for target classifier given original samples. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Shen et al., 2017</xref>) proposed AE-GAN to eliminate adversarial perturbation in an adversarial training manner, which can output images with better perceptual quality. Different from their motivations, our work aims at improving the robustness of discriminator by introducing adversarial training on real samples, which does not exist in classic GANs training framework. Similar to our motivation, (Liu &amp; Hsieh) proposed to perform projected gradient attack in supervised GAN training to robustify discriminator. In addition to that, our work clarifies that standard GAN training is approximately equivalent to adversarial training on fake samples. Moreover, we incorporate the proposed adversarial training scheme into unsupervised GAN and achieve improvement of FID score by a large margin.

The formulation using min-max optimization is as follows: min &#966; max &#952; V (&#952;, &#966;) (1) where V (&#952;, &#966;) is the objective function. Equation 1 can be formulated as a binary classification problem with cross entropy loss: V (&#952;, &#966;) = E x&#8764;P data [log D &#952; (x)] + E z&#8764;N (0,I) [log D &#952; (1 &#8722; G &#966; (z))] (2) where P data is real data distribution and noise z obeys standard Gaussian distribution. When dis- criminator is trained to be optimal, the training objective for the generator can be reformulated as Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 Jensen-Shannon divergence, which can measure dissimilarity between two distributions. In practice, we use mini-batch gradient descent to optimize generator and discriminator alternatively. At each iteration, update rule can be derived as follows: &#952; = &#952; + &#951; &#952; &#8711; &#952; V m (&#952;, &#966;, x, z) (3) &#966; = &#966; &#8722; &#951; &#966; &#8711; &#966; V m (&#952;, &#966;, x, z) (4) where &#951; &#952; and &#951; &#966; are the learning rate of discriminator and generator, respectively. V m (&#952;, &#966;, x, z) denotes the objective function of mini-batch with m real samples and m fake samples, which is:</p><p>After updating parameters of networks, fake samples generated by G &#966; (z) are adjusted as following equation according to chain rule: G &#966; (z) &#8776; G &#966; (z) &#8722; &#951; &#966; &#8706;G &#966; (z) &#8706;&#966; &#8711; &#966; V m (&#952;, &#966;, x, z) (6) = G &#966; (z) &#8722; &#951; &#966; &#8706;G &#966; (z) &#8706;&#966; ( &#8706;G &#966; (z) &#8706;&#966; ) T &#8711; G &#966; (z) V m (&#952;, &#966;, x, z) (7) where &#8706;G &#966; (z) &#8706;&#966; is a Jacobian matrix. The updated G &#966; (z) can be seen as adversarial samples of the discriminator at this iteration because &#951; &#966; is usually small. These samples will be fed into the discriminator at future iteration to perform adversarial training. From this point of view, the classic training framework mainly includes adversarial training on fake samples, which is illustrated as the first pass in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 2</xref>. Nevertheless, adversarial training of discriminator on real samples does not exist in this framework, which makes adversarial training unsymmetric and unbalanced. Adversarial noise contained in the gradient of non-robust discriminator can make training unstable because of the unsmoothed decision boundary of discriminator around real data.</p></sec><sec><title>ROUBUST OPTIMIZATION</title><p>In order to make discriminator more robust, we propose the following objective for robust optimiza- tion of discriminator:</p><p>In fact, when training data of real samples is infinite, the above objective is approximately equivalent to the original. However, in practice, training data is always limited, which partly accounts for the existence of adversarial samples. With the proposed objective, discriminator is not only required to classify real data correctly but also should not be vulnerable to small perturbation. This robust optimization training scheme can smooth the decision boundary of discriminator and prevent it from being stuck in a local minimum.</p></sec><sec><title>ADVERSARIAL TRAINING ON REAL SAMPLES</title><p>In this paper, we select adversarial training as implementation to solve the proposed robust opti- mization problem with L &#8734; -norm constraint. Specifically, we introduce adversarial training on real data that does not exist in the original framework, which can make adversarial training symmetric and stabilize GAN training. Practically, we perform adversarial training after Equation 3 at each iteration as the following equation: &#952; = &#952; + &#951; &#952; &#8711; &#952; V m (&#952;, &#966;,x, z) (9) wherex is an adversarial sample of discriminator, perturbation of which can be obtained by back- ward propagation of Equation 5 with respect to x with negligible computation overhead. The adver- sarial sample can be calculated with constant &#949; as follows:</p><p>Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020</p><p>This adversarial training formulation is adopted from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Goodfellow et al., 2015</xref>), which calculates L &#8734; -norm constrained perturbation by linearizing objective function. Adversarial training on real samples of discriminator is illustrated as the second pass in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_1">Figure 2</xref>, where L D denotes the minus of V m (&#952;, &#966;, x, z). We make adversarial training procedure symmetric by performing adversarial training both on fake samples and real samples. In this way, discriminator can provide more infor- mative gradient with less adversarial noise, which can stabilize training and accelerate convergence. Please refer to Algorithm 1 for more details about symmetric adversarial training.</p></sec><sec><title>EFFECTIVE MAGNITUDE OF PERTURBATION</title><p>It is crucial to set an appropriate magnitude of perturbation to make adversarial training effective. When perturbation set to zero, the proposed method degrades to updating discriminator twice on the same real data. When perturbation set to a too large value, real data will be drastically perturbed. Semantic information and quality will be changed, which can mislead discriminator to recognize degraded samples as real data incorrectly. In a sense, adversarial training on real samples regularizes discriminator by augmenting training data, which prevents discriminator from being too strong to alleviate training collapse. The capability of two networks become more balanced with adversarial training both on real samples and fake samples. Noteworthily, the network capacity of discriminator should be larger or at least equivalent to that of generator because discriminator is further constrained with additional adversarial training. In addition, we suggest to set pertubation to zero in the begining of training in case discriminator is too weak. We do extensive experiments on how perturbation affects training in the next section.</p></sec><sec><title>EXPERIMENTS</title><p>For the purpose of evaluating our method and investigating the reason behind its efficacy, we test our adversarial training method on image generation tasks on CIFAR-10, CelebA and LSUN with DCGAN and ResNet architecture. CIFAR-10 is a well-studied dataset of 32 x 32 natural images, containing 10 categories of objects and CelebA is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200k images. In addition, We validate the proposed method on 3000k images labeled as bedroom in LSUN . For fast validation, We resize images in CelebA and LSUN to 64 x 64. The effectiveness of the proposed method can be proved empirically by results on these distinct datasets with two widely adopted architectures.</p><p>In section 4.1, we first conduct hyper-parameter experiments on the magnitude of perturbation for unsupervised generation task on CIFAR-10. In order to study transferability on different network structure, we conduct some extensive experiments with multiple architectures and settings in section 4.2, which also demonstrate the advantages of our method that can stabilize training and accelerate convergence in section 4.3. Lastly, we compare our adversarial symmetric training method with some latest state-of-the-art GAN variants. With the same experimental settings of some classic models, our method can produce diverse images with better fidelity.</p><p>In this paper, we use standard GAN objective function as the adversarial loss. In order to alleviate gradient vanishing at the beginning of training, we adopt non-saturating loss suggested by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Good- fellow et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, we use Fr&#233;chet inception distance (FID)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Heusel et al., 2017</xref>) and inception score(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Salimans et al., 2016</xref>) to measure model performance, both of which are well- studied metric of image quality. Please refer to Appendix F for more details about implementation. Our source code will be released on Github.</p></sec><sec><title>EVALUATION WITH DIFFERENT HYPER-PARAMETERS</title><p>In order to find an appropriate magnitude of adversarial perturbation, we do unsupervised image generation experiments on CIFAR-10 with DCGAN architecture at different settings of perturba- tion. Due to the large searching space, we select several typical values for experiments such as {0,1,2,3,4}/255. Furthermore, we do ablation study by replacing gradient used to craft perturbation by Gaussian noise. All experiments are run three times independently to reduce randomness. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 3</xref> shows the FID results in the different hyper-parameter setting, Our method performs far better than baseline when &#949; lies in interval 0.5/255 &#8764; 3/255. However, no matter the perturbation Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 amplitude is too small (&#949; = 0.2/255) or a little large (&#949; = 4/255), the method improves original model slightly. In addition, when the imposed perturbation is too strong, the model performs even worse than the baseline. This is because samples perturbed drastically can mislead discriminator to recognize degraded samples as real data incorrectly, which hinders discriminator from catching true characteristic of real data distribution. With appropriate perturbation, discriminator can be regularized to balance training, which can alleviate the bothersome collapse of training loss and generate samples in standard GAN. Only when the attacking intensity is suitable, discriminator will become more robust owning to adversarial training, facilitating itself to produce more accurate and informative gradient to generator, which can promote the capability of generator tremendously. In this way, generator obtains more meaningful and reliable update information, accounting for generating better samples. Still and all, too much perturbation is harmful to discriminator when exceeding its endurance, leading discriminator to the ground defeated by generator, which is not a favorable scene. Similarly, when the imposed perturbation is too tiny, on which condition the adversarial sample of real data is almost close to the benign, the effect of adversarial training is limited. In particular, when &#949; is zero, the model degrades into regular GAN algorithm, the only change of which is updating discriminator twice on same real data. This setting is only slightly better than the baseline but far worse than the version with appropriate &#949;. Overall, results show that discriminator adversarially trained with appropriate perturbation can stabilize training and improve performance of generator. Besides, the annotation 'Gaussian' in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_2">Figure 3</xref> means that the gradient used to craft adversarial samples is replaced by Gaussian noise, whose poor performance proves that perturbation direction of gradient is important for effectiveness. In the following sections, we use &#949; = 1/255 as default option for simplicity.</p></sec><sec><title>EVALUATION WITH DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURES</title><p>To explore the transferability and compatibility of the proposed method, we test with widely adopted DCGAN and ResNet architecture on CIFAR-10 and CelebA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_3">Figure 4</xref> plots the comparison results. Additionally, two groups of contrast experiments with different setttings are performed (see Ap- pendix E). We find that our method can largely accelerate convergence and improve the fidelity of generated samples. By applying our method, stability can also be improved vastly (Appendix A.1). Even with the setting in which baseline GAN collapse thoroughly, our model can still converge toward optimization objective.</p><p>Generally, GANs collapse when discriminator is too strong or too weak; the former situation is more common during training. WGAN and a series of its variants solve the problem theoretically by using Wasserstein distance to measure the discrepancy between two distributions with constraining the Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 discriminator. Different from their approach, we address training instability in a practical point of view that discriminator as a classifier is not ideal and robust. Adversarial training on real samples is introduced into classific GAN to make discriminator more robust. Experimental results prove our method is effective with marginal computation cost and can be applied to different network architectures on different datasets.</p></sec><sec><title>IMPROVED PERFORMANCE</title><p>We perform image generation experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab_1">Table 2</xref>, through unsupervised training on CIFAR-10, CelebA and bedroom in LSUN, our model can achieve comparable performance to state of the art on FID and inception score (Higher is better). It should be noted that the four rows at the bottom show the results of our implementation. We further validate on ImageNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Russakovsky et al., 2015</xref>) resized to 64 x 64 with unsupervised AS-DCGAN and achieve a FID of 60.65 relative to 65.78 of baseline. Generated samples are shown in Appendix C.1.</p></sec><sec><title>ANALYSIS</title><p>To show how our method works, we perform some analytical experiments on CIFAR-10. Notice that in our algorithm, the only significant change for vanilla GAN is adversarial training on real samples during the two-players game. Gradient given by discriminator is the key to update generator. Hence, we visualize the gradient as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_0">Figure 1</xref>, which shows that the gradient of adversarially trained discriminator contains more semantic information, eg, profiles of face, but the gradient of standard discriminator looks like uninformative noise. We further show the histogram of the gradient of discriminator with respect to real samples as Figure 5a. Our method can obtain more sparse gradient Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 The computation overhead of the proposed method is about 25% relative to the baseline, which is comparable to that of spectral normalization and much smaller than that of gradient penalty. Comparison of average training time of one epoch of different methods is shown as Table 4.4.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The relationship between GANs and adversarial samples has been a open question since both models emerged. In this paper, we analyze that adversarial training on fake samples is already taken into account in standard GAN training framework, but adversarial training on real samples does not exist, which can make training unbalanced and unstable. This is because gradient given by non- robust discriminator contains more adversarial noise, which can mislead update of the generator. In order to make training scheme symmetric and discriminator robust, we introduce adversarial training on real samples. We validate the proposed method on image generation tasks on CIFAR- 10, CelebA and bedroom in LSUN with varied network architectures. Experiments show that the gradient of discriminator adversarially trained both on real and fake samples contains less adversarial noise. Convergence speed and performance are improved with marginal computation overhead. Moreover, mode collapse is alleviated. With simple DCGAN network architecture and standard objective function, we can achieve comparable FID to state of the art on these datasets.</p></sec><sec id="figures"><title>Figures</title><fig id="fig_0"><object-id>fig_0</object-id><label>Figure 1:</label><caption><title>Figure 1:</title><p>Visualization of the gradient of DCGAN discriminator with respect to input images.
